        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide, characterized by progressive neuron degeneration or loss due to excessive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and hyperphosphorylated tau. The treatment of AD has been only partially successful as the majority of the pharmacotherapies on the market may alleviate some of the symptoms. In the occurrence of AD, increasing attention has been paid to neurodegeneration, while the resident glial cells, like microglia are also observed. Microglia, a kind of crucial glial cells associated with the innate immune response, functions as double-edge sword role in CNS. They exert a beneficial or detrimental influence on the adjacent neurons through secretion of both pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as neurotrophic factors. In addition, their endocytosis of debris and toxic protein like Aβ and tau ensures homeostasis of the neuronal microenvironment. In this review, we will systematically summarize recent research regarding the roles of microglia in AD pathology and latest microglia-associated therapeutic targets mainly including pro-inflammatory genes, anti-inflammatory genes and phagocytosis at length, some of which are contradictory and controversial and warrant to further be investigated.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, beginning with gradual memory and cognitive impairment, abnormal behavior, and progressive social dysfunction. Pathologically, AD is characterized by severe neuronal degeneration or loss mainly resulting from excessive production of senile plaques comprising β-amyloid (Aβ) proteins, and neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposition. Furthermore, Lewy-related pathology and presynaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn), which are primarily involved in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), were discovered to participate in the eliciting several parts of the pathophysiology of AD. Although compelling studies on the pathological mechanism of AD have been carried out for decades, still no effective curative treatment for AD is available. At this present, the mechanism by which drugs used in the clinical treatment of AD are mainly targeted at cholinergic neurons, eliminating or inhibiting the toxicity of Aβ or tau proteins to neurons, and reducing the oxidative stress of neurons. Unfortunately, these drugs approved by the FDA for treatment of AD are all symptomatic treatment drugs, and are still unstable in suppression of the disease process, thus reflecting the imperious demands for effective treatments. Likewise, in molecular pathology studies, more attention has not only been paid to the neuron activities, but also the effects of microglial cells, and their abnormal changes in AD are also observed. Increasing studies have evidenced that microglial-mediated neuroinflammation also plays pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, the development of drugs that target microglia may be crucial to reverse the process of AD. This article will systematically review the latest progress of the pathogenic mechanism of AD associated with microglia cells, which is likely to discover valuable AD treatment targets so as to provide a deep insight into new therapeutic approaches for AD.",
        "conclusion": "In summary, microglia are crucial mediator and effector in the pathology of AD, but a slew of mysteries surrounding the interactions between microglia and AD remain unsolved. Neurodegeneration has been linked to microglia-associated inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-1β. In this state, microglia fail to endocytose pathological Aβ and tau, and Aβ and tau deposition contributes to inflammatory activation, resulting in a vicious cycle in AD pathology. On the contrary, anti-inflammatory factors secreted by microglia such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β, and activation of certain receptors such as TREM2, aid in the restoration of learning and memory deficits in AD via various signaling pathways and mechanisms. Furthermore, phagocytosis and autophagy of microglia mediated by some critical receptors such as SR-A and CD36 are responsible for the degradation of deposited Aβ and tau in AD. The detailed potential interaction mechanism underlying a variety of molecular events orchestrated by microglia in AD is seen in figures mentioned above and Table 1 . In the CNS, we believe that microglia, an obligatory member of the innate immune system, act as a protective factor against tumors, pathogens, and abnormally deposited proteins such as Aβ and tau. Notwithstanding, once Aβ and tau deposition exceeds that of clearance by microglia, the resulting excessive activation of microglia would release excessive pro-inflammatory factors to compromise neurons and their synapses associated with AD. In this review, we systemically summarized the microglia-associated factors, mechanisms of molecular activity, and relevant therapeutic strategies for AD that have been trialed in cell, animal models, or Alzheimer’s patients. More research has revealed that microglia play a critical role not just in AD, but also in PD, ischemia, demyelinating disease, and even psychiatric conditions such as mood disorders. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such like TNF-α and IL-6 have been shown to be increased in patients with depression, and human volunteers were indeed induced anxiety and depression by the treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-α. Drug-induced anti-inflammatory microglial phenotypes have been shown to alleviate depressive-like behavior in mice (166). Taking into account all the great advantages of microglial double-edged sword defenses previously described, there is no doubt that targeting expansion of the microglial various beneficial bio-functions will hold the potential to delay disease onset and further possibly preserve cognitive function of patient with AD. Once we achieve great therapeutic outcomes, the therapeutic strategy targeting microglia would represent a perspective strategy for suppression of the early stage of neuropathological change in AD, and avoid the family tragedy of end-stage AD."

        "abstract": "Several cardiovascular traits and diseases co-occur with Alzheimer's disease. We mapped their shared genetic architecture using multi-trait genome-wide association studies. Subsequent fine-mapping and colocalisation highlighted 16 genetic loci associated with both Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases. We prioritised rs11786896, which colocalised with Alzheimer's disease, atrial fibrillation and expression of PLEC in the heart left ventricle, and rs7529220, which colocalised with Alzheimer's disease, atrial fibrillation and expression of C1Q family genes. Single-cell RNA-sequencing data, co-expression network and protein-protein interaction analyses provided evidence for different mechanisms of PLEC, which is upregulated in left ventricular endothelium and cardiomyocytes with heart failure and in brain astrocytes with Alzheimer's disease. Similar common mechanisms are implicated for C1Q in heart macrophages with heart failure and in brain microglia with Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight inflammatory and pleomorphic risk determinants for the co-occurrence of Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases and suggest PLEC, C1Q and their interacting proteins as potential therapeutic targets.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a leading health challenge for our times. More than 55 million people worldwide were estimated to be living with dementia in 2020 with 60% -70% of them being AD cases1,2. AD has been considered a brain-specific disease whose primary pathology is confined to the brain. However, accumulating evidence suggests mechanistic links between a wide range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities and AD3–5. Epidemiological studies and experimental data have shown consistent associations between manifestations of clinical CV diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke, with higher risk of AD6–8. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this. Indeed, atherosclerosis, the main underlying cause of CV diseases, also has profound consequences on the cerebrovascular system. These include reduced blood flow and potential vascular damage in the brain, impaired cerebral perfusion, and associations with inflammation and oxidative stress, all of which are factors that can contribute to neurodegenerative pathology and increase the risk of AD9. Beyond atherosclerosis, other hemodynamic effects associated with hypertension, arteriosclerosis and subsequent aortic stiffening have been associated with cerebrovascular damage and cognitive function, potentially accelerating the onset and progression of AD10. AD and CV traits also share common genetic determinants11. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic risk loci for both AD and pathological CV traits and identified common genetic factors that may refer to the shared underlying pathways. One example of such genes is apolipoprotein E (APOE), which encodes a lipid-transport protein involved in cholesterol metabolism12, that is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD13,14 and a risk factor for adverse CV traits, including CAD15 and myocardial infarction16. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms and molecular processes that modulate the AD and CV link remain elusive. A deeper understanding of their shared genetic architecture will provide insights into potentially common and distinct aetiologies of these conditions. Identifying shared targets and mechanisms that confer functional effects could lead to the discovery of interventions that address both neurodegenerative and CV diseases. Here, we further investigated the commonalities in the genetic architecture of AD and CV traits and identified potential pleiotropic loci affecting multiple traits aiming to define common targets for therapeutic modulation. We explored a wide range of CV abnormalities and two common main risk factors, atherosclerosis and blood pressure (BP), proposed to underlie both CV and AD, to investigate different molecular pathways that may link different CV manifestations to AD. We performed a large-scale multi-trait GWAS analysis on AD and CV traits, followed by genetic colocalisation analysis to highlight candidate pleiotropic genes and their tissue sites of action. To further characterise biological pathways involved in both diseases, we leveraged data from single-cell RNA-sequence for differential gene expression with disease to explore relevant gene co-expression networks and protein-protein interactions in the brain and CV tissues. A schematic overview of the study is presented in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Study design schematic overview.AD Alzheimer’s disease, AF atrial fibrillation, CAD coronary artery disease, cIMT carotid intima media thickness, BP blood pressure, CV cardiovascular, HF heart failure.

        "conclusion": "We adopted a comprehensive approach to understand the co-occurrence between AD and various CV diseases and traits based on several multi-trait GWAS to characterise their shared genetic architecture. Convergent evidence from colocalisation between AD, AF and eQTLs prioritised two genetic regions that each included a single candidate causal variant (rs11786896 which was an eQTL for PLEC and rs7529220 which was an eQTL for C1QA, C1QB, and C1QC) shared between AD and AF. Single-cell RNA-sequence data, co-expression network and protein-protein interaction analyses together were consistent in showing that PLEC is upregulated in left ventricular endothelium and cardiomyocytes with HF and in brain astrocytes with AD. By contrast, while C1Q genes are predicted to be upregulated with greater disease risk in cardiac macrophages for HF and in brain microglia for AD, we found opposite directions of difference with disease for both. We explored differences in the direction of changes from early disease (low beta-amyloid pathology load) to late (high beta-amyloid pathology load) for microglia and found the congruence with directions predicted for disease risk in early disease that was lost with in later disease progression. Our findings provide new insights into genetic pleiotropic effects and potential shared mechanisms causally related to both AD and CV traits. Our study highlighted 5 not previously reported AD loci including SNPs located in or near HSPG2, AC019055.1, ULK4, KRT18P16 and ACTN4. Of them, the intronic variant rs73069394 (ULK4) showed the strongest association with AD and was also GWS associated with DBP. The locus did not show evidence for colocalisation between AD and DBP suggesting this variant is not likely the causal one for both traits. Apart from DBP, GWAS studies have shown associations between this locus and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder20. The role of the ULK4 in relation to neurodegeneration is little studied but the gene function shows biological plausibility to AD. ULK4 protein is involved in the regulation of autophagy and plays multiple roles in brain function including neuronal growth, endocytosis and myelination which are pathways implicated to AD pathology20,21. Here, we also provided additional evidence from SMR analysis supporting a potentially causal association between expression levels of ULK4 and AD. Out of the several CV traits and diseases examined with AD, the largest number of pleiotropic signals with AD was observed for AF and BP highlighting the importance of pathways related to these CV traits in explaining comorbidities with AD. Numerous observational studies, provide growing evidence that BP and AF are associated with cognitive impairment, risk of AD and other dementias22,23. The suggested mechanistic links between these traits and AD involve a combination of cerebrovascular damage, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta accumulation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction24,25. However, it is unclear whether the diseases have a shared pathophysiology or whether the relationship arises as downstream consequences of BP and AF (e.g., stroke). Here we provide evidence suggesting a shared genetic determinant that may contribute to the pathophysiology of AF and AD. The colocalised intronic variant rs11786896 within the plectin gene (PLEC) was associated with lower expression of PLEC in the cardiac left ventricle (and skeletal muscle) and increased the risk of both AD and AF. Furthermore, PLEC was upregulated in left ventricular endothelium and cardiomyocytes in HF cases and in brain astrocytes in AD cases. A low-frequency missense variant in PLEC has been previously associated with atrial fibrillation in a whole-genome sequencing data26 whereas another missense variant has been linked to structural brain connectivity27. The intronic variant highlighted in this analysis has been previously associated with right ventricular structure and function28 but has not been identified in GWAS studies as an AD or AF signal. PLEC is a member of a protein family, named plakins, with a crucial structural role in the cytoskeleton influencing cell architecture and tissue integrity and a partially functional role in the assembly, positioning, and regulation of signalling complexes29,30. Previous studies of human tissues or preclinical models provide independent evidence for an association of plectin with diseases including AD and AF26,31. Plectin is highly expressed in the central nervous system, especially at the interfaces between glia and pial cells and between glia and endothelial cells and is thought to be important to blood-brain barrier and pial surface integrity32. Plectin deficiency in mice has been associated with diminished learning capabilities and reduced long‐term memory compared to wild-type littermates33. Here we provide evidence that the risk of AD may be affected via functions of plectin in astrocytes34. Astrocytes play multiple roles, central to the pathology of AD, including metabolic support for neurons, modulation of brain microvascular function and, through activities associated with those of microglia, inflammatory responses34,35. We hypothesise that these functional roles are mediated in part by interactions of plectin with intermediate filaments (IFs), microtubules and actin filaments34. IFs are important structural components of the cytoskeleton with crucial roles in synaptic activity, neurogenesis and repair after brain injury36. Differences in expression of plectin modulate neuronal function and vesicular trafficking generally and interactions with tau suggest potential roles specific to AD33,37,38. The role of PLEC in AF has been largely hypothesised to act via structural effects on the heart and cause electrophysiological abnormalities26. Here, we also show evidence for upregulation of PLEC in cardiomyocytes of HF patients. Therefore, in accordance with the hypothesised mechanisms linking PLEC to AD above, PLEC may play related roles in cardiomyocytes for assembling and mobilising the intermediate filaments and their networks. These effects further modulate contractile function in cardiomyocytes and inflammatory responses in macrophages which may further contribute to AF39. Another colocalised variant between AD and AF, the intergenic rs7529220, which is located 19 k upstream from Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2) and 21 k downstream from Chymotrypsin Like Elastase 3B (CELA3B), was associated with increased risk of AD and AF and higher expression of three genes of the Complement Component 1, Q Subcomponent (C1Q) family (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC) in breast mammary tissue (and, by inference, in brain vasculature) and is a previously unreported locus for AD. The variant is located 680 kb downstream of C1Q genes. The complement system plays a central role in synaptic remodelling in the brain and in cellular damage response more generally in the body40,41. We hypothesise that greater expression of C1Q may lead to higher activity of the complement system which in turn may potentiate synapse loss in early AD42. Similarly, C1Q has roles in the genesis of atherosclerotic plaques43 and in the regulation of early stages of inflammatory responses to the cardiomyocyte injury associated with a range of cardiac traits44. The variant rs429358, located within APOE, showed evidence for colocalisation between AD and CAD. However, further investigation using eQTL could not prioritise any shared gene within the locus expressed in the examined tissues. Given APOE’s well-established role in AD and its potential involvement in other CV traits, including CAD45, it is plausible that the locus affects the two traits independently through different pathways (horizontal pleiotropy) or through a shared gene expressed in tissues other than those examined in our study. Our study had several strengths. First, we secured high statistical power for our study by including GWAS with substantial sample sizes ranging from 185,000 to 1,000,000 participants and we boosted the power even higher by performing suitable multivariate methods. Second, we combined advanced methods of genetic epidemiology and basic sciences and sought to provide supporting evidence from a variety of data. Third, exploring a wide spectrum of CV diseases pairwise enabled a comprehensive investigation into the diverse shared mechanisms underlying the relationship between different manifestations of CV conditions and AD. However, a number of limitations also must be acknowledged. We restricted our analyses to a population of European ancestry. The lack of genetic diversity may have hampered the possibility of detecting other relevant variants. Additionally, we did not investigate a considerable portion of the genetic predisposition coming from rare variants (MAF < 1%) as we excluded them from our analyses. This exclusion is a restriction of the MTAG method, in order to mitigate the risk of false-positive findings and biased results. Another limitation of using MTAG is that genetic variants that are not present in at least one GWAS dataset of each AD-CV pair were excluded from the corresponding pairwise MTAG analysis, and therefore some variants tested in one pairwise MTAG may not be tested in another. GWAS compares the cases we are studying with controls, but due to comorbidity, the number of other diseases might be higher in cases than in controls. As we used summary statistics without access to individual-level data, we couldn’t examine or address this heterogeneity. Despite this limitation, the identified shared genes remain valid and important for understanding their genetic connections. Moreover, we used statistical methods to detect pleiotropy, and therefore considered a genetic locus pleiotropic if it was statistically significantly associated with two or more phenotypes. However, this approach for identification of pleiotropic genes may not always highlight shared biological pathways, as the identified genes could affect the traits independently via different pathways (horizontal pleiotropy), or they could even be expressed in different tissues in response to different signals46,47. The GWAS for AD combined clinically diagnosed cases of AD with AD-proxy status (inferred based on whether the parent was diagnosed with dementia). The correlation between the GWAS with and without the ‘AD-by-proxy’ cases was high13 adding to the validity of this approach. Nonetheless, the inclusion of individuals with parental AD diagnoses in the original GWAS may have introduced greater heterogeneity and increased probability of misclassification, suggesting that some of our observed associations might be misestimated or influenced by other types of dementia. Considering the systemic nature of AD, which encompasses multiple pathways and various tissues, our study conducted a thorough investigation across all tissues, assuming correlations among many eQTLs across different tissues. However, it is important to acknowledge that some eQTLs from tissues not directly linked to AD or CV traits could represent false positive associations. To mitigate this, we validated our findings using single-cell and single-nuclei data obtained from brain tissue samples of AD cases and cardiac tissue samples from individuals with HF. Furthermore, due to a limited number of cells for specific cell types, we had to combine single-cell data from multiple samples. We focused on tissue samples that were already enriched for cardiomyocytes, endothelium, and macrophages. Moreover, the expression for some candidate genes in our data was limited and thus additional sequencing data and reads are needed to investigate them further. Additional RNA sequencing data of different AD and CV conditions would probably be even more informative. Finally, epidemiological data frequently encounter challenges in clarifying pathogenic mechanisms. Although we provided evidence from mechanistic experiments, the exact biological processes involved cannot be inferred. Further work is needed to validate our findings and the suggested disease pathways. In conclusion, we performed a multi-trait analysis on AD and CV traits and a subsequent colocalisation analysis detecting 16 shared genetic loci and further prioritising two shared causal variants between the aforementioned traits. Our findings define shared mechanisms for AD and different CV diseases. The complement system has been explored as a target for preventive or disease-modifying therapies in CV disease48 and AD49. Our work suggests that plectin or members of its interactome could offer new and potentially promising targets for preventive and therapeutic medicines with benefits across these common comorbid disorders."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. Currently, there are no effective disease-modifying treatments for AD. Mendelian randomisation (MR) has been widely used to repurpose licensed drugs and discover novel therapeutic targets. Thus, we aimed to identify novel therapeutic targets for AD and analyse their pathophysiological mechanisms and potential side effects. METHODS: A two-sample MR integrating the identified druggable genes was performed to estimate the causal effects of blood and brain druggable expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) on AD. A repeat study was conducted using different blood and brain eQTL data sources to validate the identified genes. Using AD markers with available genome-wide association studies data, we evaluated the causal relationship between established AD markers to explore possible mechanisms. Finally, the potential side effects of the druggable genes for AD treatment were assessed using a phenome-wide MR. RESULTS: Overall, 5883 unique druggable genes were aggregated; 33 unique potential druggable genes for AD were identified in at least one dataset (brain or blood), and 5 were validated in a different dataset. Among them, three prior druggable genes (epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2), SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11) reached significant levels in both blood and brain tissues. EPHX2 may mediate the pathogenesis of AD by affecting the entire hippocampal volume. Further phenome-wide MR analysis revealed no potential side effects of treatments targeting EPHX2, SERPINB1 or SIGLEC11.

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is the leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia.1 An estimated 6.5 million Americans aged ≥65 years are living with AD.2 This number might reach 13.8 million by 2060.2 As an age-dependent disease, AD is a threat to public health because of the rapid ageing of the world population. Over the past three decades, an increasing trend in the burden of AD has been observed globally.3 The rapid increase in the prevalence and societal and economic burden of AD has prompted an urgent need for efficient intervention and treatment for AD.4 However, AD treatment remains challenging. First, only a few drugs are available for AD.5 Second, most approved drugs exert their therapeutic effects by targeting only a few specific molecular targets. For example, almost all antidementia drugs exert their therapeutic effects by inhibiting cholinesterase enzyme or glutaminergic pathway.6 Third, in addition to their beneficial therapeutic effects, antidementia drugs have considerable side effects, including nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headache and constipation.7 Importantly, these antidementia drugs cannot cure or delay AD progression; they only provide symptomatic treatment. Over the past few decades, great efforts have been made to explore disease-modifying treatments for AD; however, little progress has been achieved. Most agents targeting amyloid beta (Aβ), aggregated tau, or neurofibrillary tangles may delay disease progression, but there is no substantial evidence suggesting their clinical benefits.8 Therapeutic stasis is primarily attributed to unknown AD pathophysiology. Fortunately, large-scale human genetic studies provide an opportunity for novel drug development for many complex diseases because drug targets supported by genetic evidence have a greater chance of success in drug discovery pipelines.9 10 In other words, ‘druggable’ genes encoding proteins or gene expression can provide powerful clues to inform drug targets.11 Over the past few years, numerous large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD risk. However, GWAS cannot clearly and directly provide clues regarding causal genes and drug targets because many identified SNPs are located in non-coding or intergene regions. Mendelian randomisation (MR) is an approach used to assess the causality between a modifiable exposure or risk factor and a clinically relevant outcome.12 MR analysis has been widely used to repurpose licensed drugs13 and discover novel therapeutic targets14 15 by integrating summary data from disease GWASs and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies. The expression levels of a gene may be considered as a kind of lifelong exposure, and eQTL located in the genomic region of the druggable genes are always considered as proxies.16 17 Therefore, we performed a systematic druggable genome-wide MR to identify therapeutic targets for AD. First, a two-sample MR analysis was performed to estimate the causal effects of blood and brain druggable eQTLs on AD. Second, we performed colocalisation analyses to verify the robustness of the expression instrumental variables (IVs) and conducted a repeat study using different blood and brain eQTL data sources to validate the identified genes. Third, we evaluated the causal relationships between the identified genes and established AD markers to explore the possible mechanisms by which these genes are involved in AD pathogenesis. Finally, we assessed the potential adverse effects of the identified druggable genes for AD treatment using a phenome-wide MR.",
        "conclusion": "The development of novel therapeutic agents for AD is extremely challenging. A major cause for this dilemma is the unknown pathophysiology of AD. In this study, based on blood and brain druggable eQTLs, we found 33 druggable gene expressions that may influence AD outcomes, 5 of which were also found in a repeated study. Indeed, our study provides robust evidence that three genes (EPHX2, SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11) are causally associated with AD, and all show evidence of genetic colocalisation with AD outcomes. Furthermore, we found associations between EPHX2 and whole hippocampal volume, which may provide potential clues to the pathological mechanisms involved in AD. In addition, phenome-wide MR highlighted additional beneficial indications of therapeutics targeting the three AD-associated genes and indicated a few potential safety concerns. EPHX2 encodes a member of the epoxide hydrolase family, which is found in the cytosol and peroxisomes. It binds to specific epoxides and converts them to the corresponding dihydrodiols.38 Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) expression is elevated in the hippocampus of AD mice, and sEH levels are also higher in the brain of patients with AD compared with healthy individuals.39 In pharmacological studies, the genetic deletion of EPHX2 or the downregulation of sEH level reduces Aβ deposition in the brain of AD model mice, prevents astrocyte reactivation and alleviates cognitive deficits.39 40 Furthermore, a proteome-wide association study integrating a smaller AD GWAS with the discovery of the Religious Orders Study, Memory and Ageing Project brain proteomes41 and a non-druggable genomic MR study using protein quantitative trait locus data42 reported that EPHX2 might affect AD. Consistent with these results, we provide druggable genetic evidence for the directionally consistent effects of EPHX2 in the blood or brain tissue on AD outcomes. We also observed that higher levels of EPHX2 may be associated with lower hippocampal volume. More importantly, through phenome-wide MR analysis, we observed no significant side effects associated with EPHX2 expression (online supplemental table S18). sEH expression is elevated in the AD hippocampus39 40; whether the pathological accumulation of sEH accelerates hippocampal atrophy and leads to AD requires further research. PF-750, a drug that inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase, weakly inhibits sEH.43 However, this compound has not yet reached phase I clinical trials (preclinical/research compound). Another drug, AR9281, may also interact with EPHX2 without a clear direction yet.44 Overall, our results indicated that EPHX2 is a promising target for treating AD by affecting hippocampal volume. However, PF-750 or compounds that target EPHX2 deserve further investigation. Serpin family B member 1 (SERPINB1) encodes a member of the serpin family of proteinase inhibitors, maintaining homeostasis by neutralising overexpressed proteinase activity through their function as suicide substrates.45 A locus associated with Aβ42 within SERPINB1 on chromosome 6p25 has been reported to be associated with AD risk in a GWAS study.46 A previous study indicated that the intronic SERPINB1 variant rs316341 affects the expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 may influence AD through an Aβ-associated mechanism.46 In addition, SERPINB1 is upregulated in patients with AD,47 and higher levels of SERPINB1 expression in the prefrontal cortex are associated with higher levels of amyloidosis.48 Our MR study also revealed that higher SERPINB1 levels increased the risk of AD. However, we found no association between SERPINB1 and AD biomarkers using MR in this study. Because of the unavailability of a large proportion of AD pathological marker GWAS data, negative results are not credible. More basic experiments and larger GWAS data are needed to determine the relationship between SERPINB1 and Aβ or other AD biomarkers. SERPINB1 is the only druggable gene under the tier 3 B term (encoding secreted or extracellular proteins, proteins with more distant similarity to approved drug targets and members of key druggable gene families not already included in tier 1 or 2) according to Finan et al.11 Currently, there are no drugs with SERPINB1 as a clear target. Heparin from bovines is predicted to interact with SERPINB1 (www.noveseek.com); however, its exact role is unclear. Our phenome-wide MR analysis showed that the association of the drug with blood SERPINB1 produced no side effects in other systems. Hence, drug development targeting SERPINB1 may be promising, and further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of SERPINB1 on the risk of AD. SIGLEC11, another robust AD-associated gene identified in the present study, encodes a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin family. It is mainly expressed in peripheral blood leucocytes, macrophages and microglia and binds to an α-2-8-linked sialic acid.49 It is a risk factor for AD.50 SIGLEC11 may be associated with ceramide-related inflammation and anti-inflammatory pathways in AD.50 In addition to our findings, higher levels of SIGLEC11 may trigger an inflammatory response that can produce neurotoxic effects or promote the deposition of pathological proteins in AD, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Further investigation of SIGLEC11 in the context of AD is required. In addition, the remaining expression products could provide further insights into anti-AD drug discovery. When comparing the MR results using eQTLs derived from the two cohorts, SIGLEC11, SERPINB1, LIMK2, CD46 and ADAM10 were repeated in at least one tissue sample. LIMK2 regulates cortical development by regulating neural progenitor cell proliferation and migration.51 Consistent with our findings, a previous study identified CD46 as significantly dysregulated in late-onset AD.52 Moreover, ADAM10 is an important enzyme in AD pathology and may function in AD via astrocytes.53 2,4-Diacetylphloroglucinol reduces Aβ production and secretion by regulating ADAM10 and its intracellular trafficking in cellular and animal models of AD.54 Furthermore, the development of ADAM10 endocytosis inhibitors for AD treatment yielded promising preclinical results.55 Therefore, multiple studies support the drug targets identified in our study. Since our primary objective was to provide genetic evidence to improve success rates in clinical trials for AD drug discovery, we decided to reduce the number of false positives. Therefore, we integrated two-stage MR (discovery and validation) in blood and brain tissues and used colocalisation analysis to identify robust druggable genes. We removed SNPs directly related to AD and AD-related diseases to prevent strengthening the MR findings using PhenoScanner. Finally, the three robust druggable genes were further analysed for AD biomarkers and phenome-wide MR. The strengths of our study include the following. Previously, there have been a few MR studies on QTLs and AD outcome42 56; however, we used the largest and latest AD GWAS,22 and our MR study is the first to study druggable genes in the context of AD and AD biomarkers. There were few significant results between markers and AD when running MR; however, we cannot exclude the association between markers and AD. Our study also has some limitations. First, the number of IVs in MR for eQTL is limited, and most are no more than three SNPs, which limits the level of confidence in the MR results. Because of the number of IVs, we only ran heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses for MR between AD markers and AD outcomes but not for the MR-involved eQTLs. Second, because the data were locked, many AD markers were not included in our study, such as neurofibrillary tangles, inflammatory plaques, soluble TREM2 and positron emission tomography images, leading to potential associations being missed. Third, the findings were not repeated at the protein level, considering that many genes did not have IVs after filtering the p value when we conducted a preliminary study. In addition, our initial findings were based on AD GWAS, including clinical and proxy cases. MR with proxy cases yields counterintuitive findings.57 Nonetheless, SIGLEC11 and SERPINB1 reached adjusted significance only in clinically diagnosed AD GWAS. This may be due to insufficient sample size and the fact that EHPX2 was not repeated. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate tissue for AD discovery. The genes that reached significant levels in the blood and brain tissues may have stronger evidence. Another key limitation is that MR analysis cannot fully recapitulate clinical trials. MR analysis differs from clinical trials, which typically investigate comparably high drug doses over a short time.14 Additionally, the GWASs conducted in the UK Biobank were restricted to Caucasians, which might restrict the applicability of our findings to other groups and races. Moreover, although all participants in the UK Biobank were of European ancestry, geographical clustering was not adjusted in the original GWASs. It was reported that the health outcomes appear geographically structured and that coincident structure in health outcomes and genotype data can yield biased associations in UK Biobank.58 Therefore, our results might be biased by population heterogeneity in the UK Biobank.58 Future studies with participants from the same region were worthy to be performed. Furthermore, we only explored the side effects of EHPX2, SIGLEC11 and SERPINB1 eQTL in diseases from the UK Biobank. However, the effects of drugs on their targets are quite extensive, and many off-target effects cannot be explored using MR. Further exploration is required through subsequent basic and clinical trials to gain a more comprehensive understanding. Finally, there were not as many approved drugs as expected, making it difficult to study new uses of the old drugs; however, we found three robust druggable genes. This study found three robust druggable genes (EPHX2, SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11) and 30 candidate druggable genes for AD. In addition, AD biomarkers and phenome-wide MR analyses of EPHX2, SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11 were conducted. In summary, we provide genetic evidence supporting the potential therapeutic benefits of three druggable genes for AD, which will be useful for prioritising AD drug development."

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main cause of dementia, is characterized by synaptic loss and neurodegeneration. Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain are considered to be the initiating factors of AD. However, this hypothesis falls short of explaining many aspects of AD pathogenesis. Recently, there has been mounting evidence that neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and causes neurodegeneration by over-activating microglia and releasing inflammatory mediators. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and MEDLINE were used for searching and summarizing all the recent publications related to inflammation and its association with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Our review shows how inflammatory dysregulation influences AD pathology as well as the roles of microglia in neuroinflammation, the possible microglia-associated therapeutic targets, top neuroinflammatory biomarkers, and anti-inflammatory drugs that combat inflammation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, microglial inflammatory reactions are important factors in AD pathogenesis and need to be discussed in more detail for promising therapeutic strategies.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD); a toxic neurodegenerative disorder is the most common cause of dementia and is becoming more common in the elderly. 1 The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that 132 million people worldwide will have dementia by the year 2050. 2 , 3 Progressive neuropathological processes in AD include neurodegeneration and loss of neuronal synapses, which are primarily brought on by an increase in amyloid‐β (Aβ) plaques accumulation and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. 4 , 5 Different risk factors have been detected for AD development such as age, cardiovascular changes, metabolic disorders, increased metal ions accumulation, and brain injury. 4 , 6 Even though amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles play a deadly role in the brain, the abnormal inflammatory mediators produced by microglia, a type of important glial cells linked to the innate immune response, 7 , 8 , 9 is one of the new hallmarks of neuroinflammation in AD. 10 Microglia cells interact with tau and Aβ, Toll‐like receptor (TLR), colony‐stimulating factor‐1 receptor (CSF1R), and receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are all activated by glial activation through the signaling pathways of apolipoprotein E (ApoE). 11 , 12 , 13 Although the initial activation of microglial cells activation by Aβ deposition is a helpful reaction for phagocytosing the burden however, extended activation of microglial cells diminishes their capacity for Aβ phagocytosis and induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide, which causes chronic inflammation and worsens AD conditions. 7 , 14 , 15 Therefore, microglial cells with their dual role may offer new therapeutic targets that could prove to be just as significant as the amyloid and tau proteins that constitute the plaques and tangles themselves. 16 Currently, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cholinesterase inhibitors are approved drugs to delay AD but none of them could cure the disease. 17 , 18 Therefore, identification of core pathologies mechanism responsible for AD and potential therapeutic targets is essential. 19 , 20 In this review, we focused on an in‐depth evaluation of microglia and their AD‐associated inflammatory factors as a new interest target of AD pathogenesis research. In addition, we highlighted the top anti‐inflammatory therapeutic approach and inflammatory biomarkers for AD treatment.",
        "conclusion": "Chronic inflammation is currently considered the third core pathology in the initiation and progression of AD, besides the well‐known studied functions of Aβ and tau. microglia cells in the central nervous system play essential roles in this inflammatory process. Activated Microglia is considered as the main source of cytokines release and triggering the inflammatory cascades in the CNS which consequently, causes loss of synapses and neurodegeneration, and increases the levels of p‐tau and Aβ. Since there are still no effective therapies in terms of disease attenuation or prevention, further research is needed to unrevealing the potential inflammatory targets and to evaluate their effects on microglia over‐activation and AD mechanisms. Finding trustworthy biomarkers is crucial for monitoring AD. By offering anti‐inflammatory treatment strategies for AD, the utilization of a multiplex model through the combination of various inflammatory biomarkers and anti‐inflammatory drugs we may improve the precision of AD diagnosis and encourage the identification of biomarker levels in the blood."

        "abstract": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an innate immune receptor predominantly expressed by microglia in the brain. Recent studies have established TREM2 as a central immune signaling hub in neurodegeneration, where it triggers immune responses upon sensing pathological development and tissue damages. TREM2 binds diverse ligands and activates downstream pathways that regulate microglial phagocytosis, inflammatory responses, and metabolic reprogramming. Interestingly, TREM2 exists both in its membrane-bound form and as a soluble variant (sTREM2), that latter is generated through proteolytic shedding or alternative splicing and can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. Emerging clinical and preclinical evidence underscores the potential of TREM2 and sTREM2 as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular functions, regulatory mechanisms, and pathological implications of TREM2 and sTREM2 in AD.

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive cognitive decline and key neuropathological features, such as amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation . While significant strides have been made in understanding these pathological markers, the role of microglia—the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS)—has gained increasing attention over the past decade. Microglia play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis; however, they become dysregulated in AD, contributing to disease progression through maladaptive neuroinflammatory responses and impaired clearance of neurotoxic materials . A key player in microglial functions is the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a transmembrane receptor that has been strongly associated with the risk for AD . TREM2 has emerged as a critical modulator in shaping microglial responses to AD, making it a compelling therapeutic target for mitigating AD-associated pathology . TREM2 signaling is mediated through its interaction with adaptor proteins DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12) and DAP10, which contain essential motifs for signal transduction . Binding of ligands—including lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, or Aβ—to TREM2 triggers intracellular signaling cascades that regulate microglial responses to AD pathology . Notably, genetic variants of TREM2, especially the R47H mutation, are strongly associated with increased AD risk . These mutations impair TREM2 functions, leading to reduced microglial activation, dysregulated inflammatory responses, impaired metabolic functions, and inadequate clearance of Aβ. Collectively, these factors exacerbate AD pathology, emphasizing TREM2’s central role in both AD susceptibility and progression, and reinforcing its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance microglial protective function and combat disease mechanisms . Beyond its role as a cell-surface receptor, TREM2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage or alternative splicing, resulting in the release of its soluble ectodomain (sTREM2) into the extracellular space, where it can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma . As both a biomarker and a potential modulator in AD, sTREM2 has been associated with microglial activation and disease progression, as evidenced by findings from human studies and AD mouse models. Elevated CSF sTREM2 levels correlate with early AD stages and neuroinflammatory responses, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker . Furthermore, preclinical and clinical studies indicate that sTREM2 may exert neuroprotective effects by mitigating Aβ and tau pathologies, potentially slowing cognitive decline and disease progression . Despite these advances, many questions remain unanswered regarding the precise mechanisms by which TREM2 and sTREM2 influence microglial functions and AD pathogenesis. Understanding the interplay between genetic variations, TREM2 signaling, and sTREM2-mediated effects could provide valuable insights into AD pathogenesis and guide the development of targeted therapies. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on TREM2 and sTREM2 in AD, focusing on their molecular functions, pathological implications, and therapeutic potential. By consolidating recent findings, we seek to highlight critical gaps in our understanding and propose future directions for advancing TREM2/sTREM2-based strategies in AD diagnostics and therapeutics.",
        "conclusion": "TREM2, both as a cell-surface receptor and in its soluble form, has emerged as a pivotal player in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Partial loss-of-function variants of TREM2 are strongly associated with increased AD risk, underscoring its protective role in maintaining microglial homeostasis. Concurrently, elevated CSF levels of sTREM2 have been correlated with slower cognitive decline and attenuated disease progression, further emphasizing its clinical significance. These findings collectively highlight TREM2 and sTREM2 as promising targets for therapeutic intervention. However, the precise mechanisms through which they modulate microglial functions and influence amyloid and tau pathologies remain incompletely understood, warranting further research. Future studies should focus on delineating the molecular mechanisms that regulate TREM2 and sTREM2 and exploring their interplay with genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic strategies targeting TREM2 and sTREM2 represent complementary approaches with significant potential in mitigating AD. Agonistic antibodies designed to activate TREM2 signaling have shown preclinical efficacy by enhancing microglial protective functions, reducing amyloid burden, and mitigating neuroinflammation . These promising findings have led to ongoing clinical trials evaluating the safety and therapeutic benefits of TREM2 activation in AD patients . Despite these promising findings, the therapeutic modulation of TREM2 remains complex. While studies on TREM2 deficiency suggest that TREM2 constrains amyloid-induced tau pathology, chronic treatment with the agonistic TREM2 antibody AL002a has been reported to enhance the seeding and spreading of phosphorylated tau, exacerbating neuritic dystrophy . These findings underscore the context-dependent nature of TREM2-targeting therapies, highlighting the need for further investigations to determine the optimal timing, disease stage, and microglial functional states that shape treatment outcomes. Meanwhile, the neuroprotective properties of sTREM2 position it as an additional target for therapeutic development. Both preclinical and clinical evidence linking elevated sTREM2 levels to reduced amyloid and tau pathologies, as well as improved cognitive outcomes, underscores the rationale for interventions aimed at enhancing sTREM2 production or mimicking its protective effects. A combination of TREM2-targeted therapies and sTREM2-based interventions could potentially provide synergistic benefits for comprehensive disease modification. However, it is important to note that several TREM2 agonistic antibodies reportedly bind to the same epitope shared by full-length TREM2 and sTREM2 . This interaction may interfere with the protective functions of sTREM2, warranting careful consideration in the design of therapeutic strategies. The timing and context of these interventions are critical, as the roles of TREM2 and sTREM2 appear to be dependent on the disease stage. Long-term therapeutic strategies must take into account these stage-specific roles to maximize their efficacy. For example, during the early stages of amyloid seeding, TREM2 signaling plays a crucial role in facilitating the clearance of amyloid seeds, thereby preventing further plaque formation . However, its effects appear to be less pronounced in later stages of amyloid pathology. Similarly, sTREM2 levels fluctuate in a stage-dependent manner, peaking during the early symptomatic phase of AD . Elevated sTREM2 levels have been associated with a reduction in Aβ accumulation and a slower rate of cognitive decline, particularly in the pre-symptomatic stage . These findings underscore the stage-specific roles of TREM2 and sTREM2 in AD pathology, highlighting the importance of precise therapeutic timing and the use of biomarkers that reflect disease progression and microglial activity to optimize intervention strategies. From a diagnostic perspective, sTREM2 shows considerable potential as a biomarker for the early detection of AD and for monitoring disease progression. Studies using TSPO-PET imaging have demonstrated a correlation between sTREM2 levels in CSF and TSPO signaling in neurodegenerative diseases , indicating that sTREM2 may serve as a potential marker for microglial activation. Since microglial activation is an early and pivotal event in the pathogenesis of AD, CSF sTREM2 could be a valuable marker for monitoring this process in clinical settings. Moreover, sTREM2 levels can help distinguish AD patients at various stages of the disease, facilitating more tailored and personalized treatment strategies. Monitoring sTREM2 levels during treatment may enable clinicians to assess the effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention and make timely adjustments as needed. Additionally, elevated CSF sTREM2 levels have been suggested to be associated with a decreased risk of MCI-to-AD conversion . Therefore, CSF sTREM2 levels may serve as a predictor of cognitive outcomes, enabling the identification of patients who are more likely to benefit from specific interventions and enhancing the precision of clinical decision-making. In summary, TREM2 and sTREM2 represent interconnected therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities in AD. Advancing our understanding of their roles, regulatory mechanisms, and clinical applications will enable the development of targeted interventions that can modify disease progression. Integrating these insights into precision medicine strategies holds substantial potential to enhance the quality of life for patients with AD and related neurodegenerative disorders."

        "title": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease: Shared Molecular Mechanisms and Potential Common Therapeutic Targets.",
        "abstract": "The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease is increasing alarmingly with the aging of the population. Numerous epidemiological data suggest that there is a strong association between type 2 diabetes and an increased risk of dementia. These diseases are both degenerative and progressive and share common risk factors. The amyloid cascade plays a key role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. The accumulation of amyloid beta peptides gradually leads to the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which then form neurofibrillary tangles, resulting in neurodegeneration and cerebral atrophy. In Alzheimer's disease, apart from these processes, the alteration of glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in the brain seems to induce early neuronal loss and the impairment of synaptic plasticity, years before the clinical manifestation of the disease. The large amount of evidence on the existence of insulin resistance in the brain during Alzheimer's disease has led to the description of this disease as \"type 3 diabetes\". Available animal models have been valuable in the understanding of the relationships between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, but to date, the mechanistical links are poorly understood. In this non-exhaustive review, we describe the main molecular mechanisms that may link these two diseases, with an emphasis on impaired insulin and IGF-1 signaling. We also focus on GSK3β and DYRK1A, markers of Alzheimer's disease, which are also closely associated with pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and type 2 diabetes, and thus may represent common therapeutic targets for both diseases.",

        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36499613/",
        "introduction": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia that arises from the impaired secretion and/or action of insulin in its target tissues. Diabetes is the most common metabolic disorder , with 537 million people affected worldwide in 2021 according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), compared to 108 million cases in 1980. This represents more than 1 in 10 adults living with diabetes. The IDF and the World Health Organization (WHO) expect this figure to increase to 643 million diabetics by 2030, due to increasing exposure to risk factors. Thus, diabetes represents a major public health issue . Clinically, there are two main forms of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, accounting for 10% of cases , arises from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells, leading to a progressive loss of insulin secretion . Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which constitutes 90% of diabetes cases , is a multifactorial disease resulting from the interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental risk factors such as a sedentary lifestyle; nutritional imbalance; stress; and environmental pollutants such as bisphenols, dioxin and pesticides , and air pollution . T2D results from peripheral insulin resistance in its target tissues, including the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. β cells attempt to compensate for insulin resistance by increasing their number and their individual secretion. However, at some point the compensation capacity is exceeded, and β-cell exhaustion and eventually β-cell apoptosis occur, leading to partial insulin deficiency and subsequent hyperglycemia . Several serious long-term complications are associated with diabetes. Most of them are the consequence of microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) or macrovascular (lower limb arteriopathy, cardiovascular accidents, and stroke) diseases. Several other co-morbid conditions are also associated with diabetes, especially comorbidities related to the central nervous system (CNS), including cognitive deficits, depression, and neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD) . In the 1990 s, the Rotterdam study provided the first epidemiological evidence of the doubling of the risk of dementia and AD in people with T2D, with a relative risk of 1.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.3–2.8) . Since then, many clinical and epidemiological studies have confirmed these data, showing a strong association between T2D and AD . Conversely, glucose intolerance and T2D are also common in AD patients and animal models . Thus, the relationship between T2D and AD is likely bidirectional. AD, the leading cause of dementia in the elderly , is a progressive neurodegenerative disease related to neuronal loss affecting the hippocampus and neocortical areas . In 2020, more than 55 million people were affected by dementia worldwide. With the aging of the population, the number of patients is expected to almost double every 20 years to reach 78 million by 2030 and 139 million by 2050, as estimated by WHO . There are two forms of AD: the familial form characterized by an early onset of symptoms, around the age of 50, due to an autosomal dominant inheritance of mutations in the genes encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2) that affect the production of the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ); and the sporadic form that accounts for more than 95% of patients, and which usually develops after the age of 65 . Clinically, AD is characterized by a gradual loss of memory followed by a deeper deterioration in cognitive function , manifesting as amnesia, aphasia, agnosia, and apraxia and associated with behavioral and personality changes . This ultimately results in the loss of a patient’s autonomy. Anatomically, AD is associated with two types of major lesions: (1) amyloid or senile plaques formed by the extracellular aggregation of insoluble Aβ peptide fibrils and (2) the phosphorylation and destabilization of tau (tubulin-associated unit), a microtubule-associated protein whose aggregation forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within neurons . According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, toxic levels of the Aβ peptide contribute to NFT formation . Both these lesions lead to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, and finally to neurodegeneration , causing brain atrophy in certain areas, particularly the cortex and hippocampus . T2D and AD share similar etiological factors. Both conditions are degenerative, with neuronal and β-cell loss in AD and in T2D, respectively , and multifactorial. The pathogenesis of the sporadic form of AD involves genetic and environmental risk factors . The most important factors are aging and the ApoE4 (apolipoprotein E4) allele , which plays a role in the clearance of the Aβ peptide . However, the female sex , and cardiovascular risk factors such as stroke, poorly controlled high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and diabetes are suggested to be among the potential predisposing factors . Indeed, AD could be considered a central metabolic disease due to glucose hypometabolism , associated with impaired insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways in the brain, which are physiologically involved in energy production and neuronal survival and plasticity, and therefore play a key role in cognition and memory . These metabolic disruptions occur years before the onset of AD and worsen with AD progression . The evidence for a relationship between insulin resistance and cognitive decline has led researchers to refer to AD as “type 3 diabetes” . Given the alarming rise in the prevalence of T2D and the aging of the world’s population, the socio-economic burden of these two diseases is expected to increase in the upcoming years . Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that link T2D to AD in order to establish common preventive and ultimately curative measures to delay the onset and restrain the progression of these two pathologies is a major research challenge. The aim of this review is to illustrate the common cellular and molecular pathways involved in AD and TD2, with a focus on the physiological importance of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in the brain, and its alteration during AD. We also highlight the role of the GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β)- and DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A)-dependent pathological mechanisms that contribute to the development of both T2D and AD. Mechanisms such as inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, the ApoE4 allele, and advanced glycation end-products, which are important mediators acting synergistically to induce these pathological conditions , are not discussed in this review.",
        "conclusion": "Although T2D and AD were initially considered two independent pathologies, substantial epidemiological arguments show an increased risk of developing AD in diabetic patients, and there is now sufficient experimental evidence of a common pathophysiological mechanism for these two diseases. Beyond its canonical role in maintaining energy homeostasis, insulin is a neurotrophic and neuroprotective factor important for maintaining cognitive function, prompting many researchers to consider AD as a metabolic disease linked to insulin deficiency. Anatomical and functional abnormalities are found in the same brain areas in T2D and AD. In this non-exhaustive review, we presented the main molecular mechanisms of degeneration, in which T2D contributes to the development and progression of AD. Targeting these pathways with antidiabetic therapies could be an approach to correct defective insulin signaling in the brain and limit neurodegeneration. Notably, the intranasal administration of insulin has been beneficial in improving memory in AD patients who do not have the ApoE4 allele. The beneficial effects of insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin, GLP-1 and its analogues, DPP-IV inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones are also being assessed in AD. In this review, we also emphasized the role of two enzymes, GSK3β and DYRK1A, which have deleterious roles both in T2D and AD. The aberrant activation of these kinases results in the hyperphosphorylation of tau and the aberrant cleavage of APP, leading to amyloid accumulation. In turn, these products induce defective insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, thereby establishing a vicious cycle. On the other hand, the activation of DYRK1A and GSK3 β induces β-cell loss and dysfunction, leading to insulin deficiency, which is not only the root-cause of T2D pathogenesis, but also an important contributor to brain dysfunction. With the recent findings regarding the crucial roles of GSK3β and DYRK1A in diabetes pathogenesis, we believe that the development of potent and selective inhibitors for these targets could be of great importance to treat both T2D and AD. Given the alarming progression of these two pathologies in our aging societies, it is highly recommended to decipher the pathophysiological mechanisms linking T2D to AD, and to identify common molecular targets for their treatment."

        "abstract": "GLP-1 is derived from intestinal L cells, which takes effect through binding to GLP-1R and is inactivated by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Since its discovery, GLP-1 has emerged as an incretin hormone for its facilitation in insulin release and reduction of insulin resistance (IR). However, GLP-1 possesses broader pharmacological effects including anti-inflammation, neuro-protection, regulating blood pressure (BP), and reducing lipotoxicity. These effects are interconnected to the physiological and pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), hypertension, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently, the underlying mechanism of these effects is still not fully illustrated and a better understanding of them may help identify promising therapeutic targets of AD, hypertension, and NASH. Therefore, we focus on the biological characteristics of GLP-1, render an overview of the mechanism of GLP-1 effects in diseases, and investigate the potential of GLP-1 analogues for the treatment of related diseases in this review.",
        "year": "2021",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34552561/",
        "introduction": "With the assistance of prediction and decipherment of recombinant cDNA clones, it has been claimed that the anglerfish preproglucagon cDNA encodes a different glucagon-related peptide (1–3). Afterwards, two glucagon-related peptides, glucagon-like peptides 1 and 2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2), were recognized in the hamster (4), rat (5), and human (6) proglucagon sequence. In various experimental models, GLP-1, which is extracted from the intestines of humans and the porcine gut, can promote glucose-dependent insulin secretion (7–9). Based on this, GLP-1 is classified as an incretin hormone (10), promoting its use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the preceding 20 years, copious strategies for treating T2DM have been generated in various clinical and fundamental studies. However, apart from its role in improving glucose control, extensive effects of GLP-1 and its broad potential in pharmacology still remain to be explored. Other studies have shown that GLP-1 possesses neuroprotection functions along with enhancement of cognitive functions (11). Moreover, GLP-1 analogues, including Liraglutide (LG) and exendin-4, possess longer half-lives than native GLP-1 and provide prospects for broader clinical applications (12). Studies have also shown that LG possesses neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory effects, which could conceivably delay the progression of AD (13). As of right now, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of GLP-1 analogues have been investigated in AD, while more detailed actions of them still remain to be clarified. Additionally, numerous investigations found that blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) increased transiently when normal rodents were given the acute infusion of GLP-1R agonists (14) while chronic injection of that reduces BP in mice studies (15). This decrease in BP was found in hypertensive patients with T2DM when they were given GLP-1R agonists over a long period of time (16). It is possible that the difference in injection speed and physiological status could account for these opposite BP alterations which were induced by GLP-1 and GLP-1R agonists. Along with that, GLP-1 has a close correlation with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by hepatic inflammation and cell injury. NASH has currently been regarded as the main cause of the increased burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (17), but the molecular mechanism of it is still complex and multifactorial (18). Moreover, the use of GLP-1 analogues LG and Exendin-4 effectively reduced both their weight and liver fat in NASH patients (19). Based on the findings above, this review focuses on the biological characteristics and the underlying mechanistic effects of GLP-1 in AD, BP, and NASH.",
        "conclusion": "To sum up, GLP-1 has extensive effects based on its biological characteristics through binding to GLP-1R. Apart from being used for treating T2DM, GLP-1 has a close relationship with AD and BP. Correspondingly, it is confirmed that GLP-1 analogues have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, which could alleviate learning and memory dysfunctions in the AD brain. GLP-1 is related to BP which depends on species, administration methods and physiological conditions. However, the principle of GLP-1 regulating BP is still not fully understood. Due to the ability to ameliorate IR and lipotoxicity in the pathogenesis of NASH, GLP-1R is a potential therapeutic target for NASH. In conclusion, GLP-1 provides a novel approach for treating AD, hypertension and NASH."

In this study, we generated a genomic atlas of protein levels in three tissues relevant to neurological disorders (brain, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma) by profiling thousands of proteins from participants with and without Alzheimer's disease. We identified 274, 127 and 32 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and brain, respectively. cis-pQTLs were more likely to be tissue shared, but trans-pQTLs tended to be tissue specific.

        "introduction": "Genetic studies have been successful in identifying genetic regions associated with complex traits, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases among others1–4. However, the studies have fallen short in promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying those traits. Most GWAS identify multiple disease loci rather than functional variants or genes, which makes it difficult to biologically interpret association results and to identify novel biomarkers and drug targets. By leveraging gene-expression and genetic data generated by multiple studies5,6, including the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, it has been possible to identify the functional variants or genes driving some GWAS signals. GTEx and others5,7–9 have shown that there are more tissue-specific expression QTLs (eQTLs) in trans than in cis, and that to identify disease relevant functional genes, it is important to interrogate the tissue of interest for the specific trait in question. However, eQTL mapping has not been able to fully identify the functional variants and genes driving GWAS signals. One explanation is that many genetic variants alter protein levels without affecting transcript levels10. Several published studies analyzed the genetic architecture of protein levels, but most are focused on a single tissue, mainly plasma10–13. A few studies with smaller sample sizes investigate CSF14,15 or brain tissue16. These studies suggest that a sizeable proportion of pQTLs are not eQTLs and that additional GWAS signals can be mapped to protein levels. Integration of pQTLs with MR has identified pathways and biomarkers for complex traits as well as potential therapeutics that could be repurposed10. In this study, we combined high-throughput proteomics from multiple tissues with genetic data to determine the genetic architecture of protein levels in neurologically relevant tissues (brain, CSF, and plasma). This integration led to the identification of tissue-shared and tissue-specific pQTLs that are critical for the understanding of the biology of complex traits, particularly neurological diseases.",
        "conclusion": "In this study we generated a detailed map of multi-tissue pQTLs that will be crucial for understanding the tissue-specific genetic architecture of protein levels. By leveraging this data, we have been able to map some additional GWAS loci, identify additional causal proteins implicated in disease pathogenesis, identify novel biomarkers, and reposition drugs. If we want to fully understand the genetic architecture of complex traits, we need to understand the genetic architecture of protein levels. Until now, multi-tissue pQTL mapping has been constrained by the limited availability of large-scale proteomic analyses in multiple tissues. We present the largest brain and CSF pQTL analyses to date, the first neurologically-relevant multi-tissue pQTL study, and a unique resource for leveraging multi-tissue pQTL to understand neurological traits. These data can be further used to perform MR analysis on other complex traits with available GWAS. All results can be downloaded from https://www.niagads.org/datasets/ng00102 and interactively accessed through a PheWeb43-based website, the Online Neurodegenerative Trait Integrative Multi-Omics Explorer (ONTIME; https://ontime.wustl.edu/). To achieve personalized medicine, these results highlight the need to implement additional functional genomic approaches beyond gene expression towards understanding the biology of complex traits and to identify potential drug targets for those traits. We predict that this and other studies including additional omic layers (e.g. epigenomics, metabolomics) will be instrumental in advancing the field."

        "introduction": "Recent advances in systems biology have shown that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate a multitude of host physiologic responses to microbiota.1,2 Indeed, broad distribution of GPCRs in the gastrointestinal tract and brain likely shape the “gut-brain axis” and other aspects of human pathophysiology.3,4 Of those, over 100 GPCRs are currently considered “orphan GPCRs,” for which the endogenous ligands are not known and the physiological roles are poorly understood.5 Limitations in the field’s ability to identify metabolite-GPCR regulation have precluded understanding of the pathophysiology and therapeutic development. Interestingly, functional screening has revealed that several gut metabolites are agonists of orphan GPCRs.1,6–9 For example, orphan GPR35 is activated by 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in neutrophil recruitment,10 and orphan GPR84 is agonized by medium-chain fatty acids in inflammation.11 Furthermore, recent advances in computational sciences and structural biology, such as AlphaFold2,12 offer unprecedented opportunities to investigate the relationship between structure and function, in particular for orphan GPCRs without known structures. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by multiple pathophysiological etiologies, including both genetic and environmental factors.13–17 Deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylation of tau are two hallmarks of AD.18 Mitophagy,19,20 cellular senescence,21 and inflammation22 have been linked to pathophysiology of AD as well. Without the development of effective clinical prevention strategies and disease-modifying treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process in AD,23 there are predicted to be more than 13.8 million people with AD living in the United States by 2050.13 The environmental exposome, which is the measure of cumulative exposures of an individual across their lifetime, also plays a crucial role in the etiology and progression of AD.24,25 With our increasing lifespans, the magnitude of the exposome effect is also increasing in society today. Indeed, alterations in the gutmicrobiome and microbe-associated metabolites are increasingly regarded as an important neural exposome linked to the pathophysiology of AD.26–28 Growing evidence also shows that patients with AD-related dementia or mild cognitive impairment display microbial dysbiosis characterized by enterotype diversity and abundance.29,30 Recent studies have additionally suggested that alterations in microbiota could contribute to AD-related pathologies in both the central and peripheral nervous systems.24,31 For example, microbiota depletion attenuates inflammation and brain pathology in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mouse model of AD,32 and aging-associated neurocognitive and immune decline is ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplant from young to aged mice.33 Advanced metabolomic approaches have also recently identified that both trimethylamine N-oxide,34 δ-valerobetaine,35 and N6-carboxymethyllysine36 are elevated in AD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking gut microbial metabolites and their levels to AD remain largely unknown. This is a critical area of investigation because identification of medically relevant gut-brain axis37 interactions would foster the discovery and development of therapeutic approaches for AD. Here, we present a systems biology framework that integrates machine learning (ML) with network-based genetics approaches and multi-omics to prioritize potential therapeutic targets from the GPCRome and microbiota-derived metabolite-GPCR relationships. We evaluated over 1.09 million metabolite-GPCR pairs using structure-derived computational biophysical approaches (i.e., AlphaFold2) and ML models. This enabled genetics-derived Mendelian randomization (MR) and multi-omics analyses, including human brain-specific transcriptomics and proteomics, which identified potential druggable GPCR targets (including orphan GPCRs) for AD. This framework thus offers a powerful tool to identify potential gut metabolite-based therapies that target human GPCRs for treating AD. In principle, this approach could be readily applied to generate insights into other human complex diseases as well.",
        "conclusion": "Much effort has been devoted to developing therapeutics based on targeting disease-modifying modalities or genetic factors in AD. However, thus far, over 99% of clinical trials have failed,88 highlighting the heterogeneous etiopathology and pathogenesis of AD. While recent advances indicate that alterations of microbiota or microbiota-derived metabolites modulate neurological disorders,89 insufficient understanding of the targets of microbial products limits microbiota-targeted therapeutic development and clinical translation. Notably, microbiota-based therapeutics have been employed to treat autism spectrum disorder,90 which serves as a proof of principle that other potential therapies for brain health, including AD, may also be derived by microbiota targeting. ML applications have been applied to predict the ligand-GPCR bioactivity.91 In this study, we established a metabolite-specific GPCR-ML model by the following strategies: (1) implementing a metabolite-mimicking training dataset from experimentally determined ligand-GPCR pairs with high bioactive affinity (pKi [inhibition constant] ≥ 6) (Figure S23) and (2) implementing 3D features of GPCRs to represent ligand-protein physical interactions. The selected 3D feature is consistent with previous studies92 (Figure S24). Moreover, we validated the GPCR-ML model using an external experimental dataset (Figure S11). For example, we predicted that serotonin had the strongest GPCR-ML score with the 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 1F (5HT1F). The bioactive metabolite 7,27-dihydroxycholesterol was ranked as a top metabolite for orphan GPR183, suggesting the potential of the GPCR-ML score to prioritize interactions between metabolites and orphan GPCRs. Our inferred gut-GPCR interactions are publicly accessible through an interactive database (https://gut-gpcrome.lerner.ccf.org/). Of the 93 potential alzGPCRs we prioritized (Figures 2, 3, and 4), MR-supported VIPR2 has been reported to inhibit Aβ-induced neurodegeneration in microglia.93 Orphan OPN4, related to disruption of circadian rhythm in AD,94 is significantly down-regulated in human AD hippocampus (Figure 2B; AD vs. healthy control, FDR = 1.54 × 10−3). VIPR2 and OPN4 were predicted to potentially bind with fatty acids (stearic acid and oleic acid, respectively). CX3CR1 and CXCR4 are chemokine receptors that were prioritized here by transcriptomic or proteomic analysis, and their activation has been implicated in protection from tau pathology.95 The top-ranked candidate metabolite for CX3CR1 is 8-hydroxyquinoline and for CXCR4 are N-butyrylglycine and rac-glycerol 1-myristate (a fatty acid derivative). GPR183, an immunomodulatory EBI2 receptor, was recently reported to be antagonized by a gut metabolite lauroyl tryptamine derived from E. rectale.96 HCAR2 (GPR109A), a microglial receptor playing a protective role in AD,97 was activated by nicotinic acid derived from R. guavus.6 Here, we identified the top-ranked candidate metabolites for GPR183 as phenylthanolamine and tryptophan ethyl ester. We also identified ADRA2A, an adrenergic receptor for which pharmacologic blockade significantly reduced Aβ in AD mice.98 ADRA2A is also targeted by the gut microbial metabolite phenylacetyl glutamine (an amino acid derivative).99 Here, we predicted that raffinose was a potent ligand for ADRA2A. GPC5B, a class C orphan receptor, was highly expressed in the central neural system.100 Our multi-omics analysis suggested that GPC5B was over-expressed in patients with AD, and its top-ranked candidate metabolite was 5-phenylvaleric acid. Further experimental validations for these predicted GPCR-metabolites are highly warranted in the future. Our MR analysis suggested that PTAFR binds to the AD candidate metabolite phosphoethanolamine (Figure 5A). PTAFR is activated by the platelet-activating factor, which has been implicated in the neurotoxicity of AD.101 The antagonists of platelet-activating factor showed protective effects on the Aβ-damaged neurons.102 Our functional study validated that the levels of C3AR and p-tau were reduced by agmatine, which has been reported to improve cognitive decline in AD rats.103 Deletion of C3AR rescued the tau pathology in the mice model, and STAT3 signaling was induced by C3AR activation to mediate tau pathogenesis.75 Thus, agmatine potentially attenuated the p-tau pathology through impeding the STAT3 signaling of C3AR. In addition, we also experimentally observed that phenethylamine reduced the p-tau levels in AD patient iPSC-derived neurons. Phenethylamine, a trace amine, has been associated with reduced risk of AD.104 We predicted that phenethylamine interacted with GPR153, an understudied GPCR widely expressed in human brains. GPR153 knockdown rats exhibited significant reduction in the percentage of time spent in the center square.105 Using brain transcriptomic data, we found that GPR153 is highly differentially expressed in 4 AD mouse brain transcriptomic datasets (Figure 2B; Table S18). However, due to very few functional studies on GPR153, the molecular mechanisms of how phenethylamine decreased the tau level via GPR153 are warranted to be further determined. Collectively, our findings are consistent with a previous report that GPCRs play an important role in AD pathology,106 including amyloid, tau, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Our results also support that notion that GPCRs play important roles in mediating signaling between host and microbiota by interacting with human gut microbial metabolites, especially orphan GPCRs. For example, FFA2 ([Free fatty acid receptor 2], GPR41) and FFA3 (GPR43) interact with short-chain fatty acids.4 Functional screening showed that bacterial phenylpropanoic acid is a potential agonist of orphan GPR109B (EC50 = 208 μM),6 and mouse models suggested that commensal metabolite N-palmitoyl serinol activates orphan GPR119 with an EC50 of 9 μM.1 Gut bacteria screening for non-olfactory GPCRome identified that L-phenylalanine was produced by B. theta C34 as an agonist for GPR56 (AGRG1) and GPR97 (AGRG3) (EC50 > 1 mM).9 Apart from human gut microbial metabolites, food-/diet-derived or endogenous metabolites also play vital roles in AD pathology. For example, elevated dietary phylloquinone (vitamin K1) has been associated with better cognitive function in patients with AD.107 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a critical metabolite linked to aging,108 and recent evidence demonstrated that mitochondria stimulation by NAD+ could reverse memory impairment in Caenorhabditis elegans models of AD.19 Moreover, treatment of AD rats, and mouse models of traumatic brain injury that relate to AD, with a pharmacologic agent that stabilizes NAD+/NADH without elevating NAD above normal achieves profound neuroprotective effect.109–112 Thus, our approaches may also be useful for identifying potential targets of food-/diet-derived or endogenous metabolites. Lastly, emerging evidence has also shown that gut microbiota altered mitochondria metabolism.113 For example, the metabolite N6-carboxymethyllysine has been linked to increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia from the brains of aged mice.36 In fact, dysfunctional mitochondria is a hallmark of brain aging related to AD,114 and removal of defective mitochondria diminished insoluble Aβ in AD mice and abolished AD-related tau hyperphosphorylation in human neuronal cells.19 Furthermore, two naturally occurring compounds (kaempferol and rhapontigenin) have been shown to increase the survival and functionality of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons and improve animal memory.20 Taken together, the regulation of mitochondria by gut-derived metabolites is a potential approach for mitigating AD pathology. In summary, our findings show that combining network-based multi-omics and ML approaches with functional observations in patient iPSC-derived models would be an effective way to identify the mechanism of actions of AD-related gut microbial metabolites. This method of identifying human gut metabolite-GPCR networks thus provides insights into elucidating the role of gut microbiota in AD, and this approach could be applied for understanding and treating other human diseases as well if broadly applied."

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, possesses a high level of heritability estimated to be between 58% and 79%. 1 Characterizing the genetic architecture of AD would improve our understanding of pathological mechanisms and enable us to identify new therapeutic targets for AD. Previous genome‐wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of AD‐associated common variants in genes like apolipoprotein E (APOE), BIN1, and CLU. 2 However, these GWASs were limited by the coverage density of the genome and the power to detect low‐frequency variants with strong effects. 3 Whole exome sequencing (WES) is effective in discovering causal and protein‐coding rare variants, 4 which can fill the literature gap in the genetic architecture of AD. Utilizing WES, several rare variants in TREM2, SORL1, ABCA7, ATP8B4, and ABCA1 have been highlighted for AD. 5 Nevertheless, the currently reported common and rare variants can only partially explain the heritability of AD. Thus, it is necessary to enlarge the WES sample to explore additional AD‐related variants and corresponding genes. In this study, we first performed the gene‐based exome‐wide association study (ExWAS) of rare variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] < 1%) and single‐variant ExWAS of common variants (MAF ≥ 1%) for AD and related dementia (ADRD) incorporating WES data of 349,990 participants from UK Biobank (UKB). The results were validated in other independent cohorts. Second, we explored the biological function of ExWASs‐identified genes in phenotype, tissue, cell, pathway, and protein‐protein interaction network (PPIN). Third, we tested the causal and longitudinal relationships of ExWASs‐identified genes with ADRD. Finally, for the identified novel genes, we looked up their potential in drug development (Figure 1). We aim to decipher the genetic basis and underlying pathological mechanism of ADRD.",
        "conclusion": "This study leveraged large‐scale exome sequencing data to elucidate the genetic determinants for ADRD. We identified 11 genes by gene‐based ExWAS of rare variants and 17 genes by single‐variant ExWAS of common variants. Among the identified genes, seven novel genes presented exome‐wide significance for ADRD, and five of them were validated in another independent cohort, including FRMD8, DDX1, DNMT3L, MORC1, and TGM2. Functional annotations found that the identified genes were enriched in brain tissues and microglia as well as in pathways mainly associated with Aβ and lipid metabolism. Additional evidence from differential expression analyses, MR and Cox regression further supported the significance of these genes in ADRD. Druggability investigation of novel genes indicated that DDX1, DNMT3L, TGM2, SLCO1C1, and NDNF were potentially effective drug targets. These findings contribute to the current body of evidence on the genetic etiology of ADRD. , The results presented in the current study were in agreement with those reported in the literature and extended genetic research in ADRD. First, our ExWASs have overlapping findings with published GWASs. Half of the 27 ADRD‐related genes identified from our study have been reported in previous large‐scale GWAS of AD, 50 suggesting the convergence between ExWAS and GWAS approaches. Similarly, the pathway enrichment analysis showed consistent results with previous findings which mainly involved four function clusters including APP metabolism/Aβ formation and lipid metabolism, 51 and were supported by the interaction network analysis of the identified genes. The scRNA‐seq analysis with recently released brain expression data showing genes most highly expressed in microglial cells were also in line with cell enrichment results from GWAS‐identified genes, 51 highlighting their critical role in AD biological processes. Secondly, our study replicated findings from recent ExWASs. Three genes identified from our gene‐based ExWAS analyses, SORL1, ABCA7, and ADAM10, have been reported by the ExWAS based on the ADES consortium, ADSP, and several other independent cohorts. 5 The SORL1 was also reported in a recent paper by Wightman et al. using the UKB dataset. 52 Specifically, the significant contribution of rs140327834 (chr11:121625107:A > T) to the association for SORL1 was also identified, which was a missense leading to aspartate‐to‐valine substitution and was predicted to be potentially damaging. 53 , 54 Compared to the work by Wightman et al. (22,080 cases and 126,428 controls, data accessed in 2020), our study used new‐released genetic and phenotypic data, leading to a remarkably increased power. Additionally, we performed a detailed variant annotation with more functional categories included in the analyses, and even ultra‐rare variants (MAF < 0. 01%) were retained in the statistic models, which enabled us to identify more ADRD‐related genes. Importantly, a series of post‐ExWAS analyses in our study were performed to enhance the robustness of findings, such as differential expression analyses, enrichment analyses, MR and Cox regression, and so on. The advantages mentioned above advance our work and promote new discoveries. Several variants identified from the single‐variant ExWAS were previously reported to be associated with AD with different underlying mechanisms. The strongest signal, PILRA rs1859788 (A > G), was a missense variant that led to the substitution of glycine for arginine. 55 This substitution could alter the ligand binding affinity of PILRA and has been suggested to be protective for AD. 55 Both CLU rs7982 and PICALM rs592297 are located in the 5th exon of the gene and play a functional role in gene splicing for AD. CLU rs7982 influences alternative splicing of CLU in a region‐dependent and exon‐specific way, 56 , 57 while PICALM rs592297is an exonic splice enhancer that impacts atrophy of the posterior cingulate and hippocampus. 58 APH1B rs117618017 is a missense variant in exon 1 (p.Thr27Ile) and is likely the single causal variant at its locus with a fine‐mapping probability of 90%. 59 Recent studies have shown that its minor allele increases the risk of AD by directly increasing APH1B expression, rather than by changing the protein sequence. 60 , 61 MS4A6A rs12453 (T > C) has an unexpected functional outcome as well since it is a synonymous variant. 62 Its strong association with AD risk may be explained by high linkage disequilibrium with the risk variant in the CTCF binding site (rs636317). 63 While these variants have been shown to be associated with AD risk and phenotypes, the other seven major variants identified in our study including BIN1 rs11554586, CR1 rs4844600, ABCA7 rs3752241, BTNL2 rs9268480, SLCO1C1 rs34243130, NDNF rs1397645, and TMC5 rs1397645 have been rarely reported. Further investigations are needed to understand their underlying mechanism for AD. A total of seven novel genes were identified by the ExWAS, with multiple pieces of evidence being most consistent for FRMD8, DDX1, DNMT3L, MORC1, and TGM2. FRMD8 (FERM domain containing eight) encodes a protein that promotes the cell surface stability and regulates the inflammatory and growth factor signaling. 64 , 65 DDX1 (DEAD‐box helicase 1) encodes protein characterized by the conserved motif Asp‐Glu‐Ala‐Asp (DEAD) that acts as an ATP‐dependent RNA helicase. Despite moderate‐to‐strong evidence from our differential expression analyses in the brains of AD versus controls, the biological functions of FRMD8 and DDX1 in the central nervous system remained largely undiscovered. Future experimental research is needed to clarify their functional relevance to AD as well as their causal molecular mechanisms. DNMT3L (DNA methyltransferase‐3‐like) encodes an enzymatically inactive regulatory factor of DNA methyltransferases that can either promote or inhibit DNA methylation depending on the context. 66 Recent studies found that the interaction of nutrition and genetics via DNMT3L‐mediated DNA methylation determined cognitive decline 67 and DNMT3L had differentially hydroxymethylated regions in AD post mortem brain tissues versus controls. 68 This supported our findings and suggested that the DNMT3L was involved in the pathophysiology of AD. The protein encoded by MORC1 (Microchidia family CW‐type zinc finger 1) is required for spermatogenesis and essential for de novo DNA methylation and silencing of transposable elements in the male embryonic germ cells. Previous research found its methylation was associated with microstructural features of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, and it was suggested to be involved in the neurobiological process of neuropsychiatric disorders. 69 , 70 TGM2 (Transglutaminase 2) encodes a multifunctional transamidation acyltransferase that catalyzes calcium‐dependent post‐translational modifications that induce protein cross‐linking, glutamine deamination, polyamine incorporation, and guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis. 71 , 72 A recent experimental study found an association between TGM2 and Alzheimer's pathogenesis. The silencing of TGM2 could prevent Aβ‐induced mitochondrial calcium influx, ROS accumulation, Tau phosphorylation, and cell death in neuronal cells. 71 This result may support one of our interesting findings that rare TGM2 variants in APOE4 carriers were associated with a further increased risk of incident ADRD. The study of rare variants promotes a full understanding of the genetic architecture for AD. With both exome sequencing and genome‐wide genotype data in the UKB, we investigated the relative contribution of common variant‐based PRS and rare coding variant burden to AD risk. Carriers of such variants had higher risks for AD and incremental risk showed an increasing trend with PRS, which implied that AD risk might vary depending on an individual's genetic profile of common risk variants and carrier status for these rare variants and rare coding variants affected additively to PRS. This suggests that carrying rare or common risk variants could serve as distinct pathways to AD onset and that genetic prediction may be further improved by combining PRS and the rare coding variant burden. Similar findings were reported previously for other common complex phenotypes. 73 , 74 Intriguingly, our study provides some genetic support for the sex difference in AD. In stratification analyses of gene‐based ExWAS, genes such as SORL1 and PSEN1 showed significant associations with AD in females whereas no genes were identified in males. Additionally, the variant rs7982 (CLU) identified in the single variant ExWAS was previously found to be associated with alternative splicing of CLU in all three brain regions tested in women including the temporal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus, while the association was significant only in temporal cortex in men. 56 These results may provide a clue for further research into the sex's effect on AD pathogenesis. Our study had several limitations. First, the study was conducted among White British participants. It is undetermined how well the results from our study can be extrapolated to other ancestries. We anticipate that large, diverse samples will become more readily available to further verify our findings and make new discoveries. Second, proxy ADRD and non‐AD dementia cases were included. Although the sample size and power can be boosted with this approach, the discovered genes should be cautiously interpreted as phenotypic heterogeneity may point to dementia‐related genes instead of AD‐specific genes. Further analysis in AD cohorts or experimental research is also warranted to validate the findings from the study with a similar design. In particular, the functional consequences of the identified rare variants in relation to AD development need to be further investigated. Third, our study did not assess the effect of other structural variants such as copy number variants and repetitive sequences. Evaluations of these genetic variations will contribute to the complete characterization of the genetic background of AD and may provide additional insights into the disease mechanism. Fourth, The FinnGen data replication were based on single variants, thus a strict replication analysis of the burden of rare variants cannot be performed in this cohort. Finally, even if the coding variants in gene‐based analyses are rare, it cannot be excluded that they still tag a haplotype that has another variant(s). In conclusion, our study using WES data from a large cohort identified novel genes and variants for ADRD and confirmed the well‐established genetic factors. The findings strengthen the current understanding of the genetic architecture of AD and provide new insights into pathological mechanisms and therapeutic targets."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that develops over decades.

Proteins in the most conserved network (M42) accumulate in plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid (CAA), and/or dystrophic neuronal processes, and overexpression of two M42 proteins, midkine (Mdk) and pleiotrophin (PTN), increases the accumulation of Aβ in plaques and CAA. M42 proteins bind amyloid fibrils in vitro, and MDK and PTN co-accumulate with cardiac transthyretin amyloid. M42 proteins appear intimately linked to amyloid deposition and can regulate amyloid deposition, suggesting that they are pathology modifiers and thus putative therapeutic targets.

        "introduction": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis serves as a foundational framework for comprehending the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1,2 Evidence from anti-amyloid immunotherapies, developed based on this hypothesis, offers the initial therapeutic validation, affirming that Aβ deposition plays a role in the AD pathogenic cascade.3,4,5 Despite extensive investigation, significant gaps in our understanding of AD pathogenesis remain.2,6,7 The initial notion of a purely linear amyloid cascade is now recognized as overly simplistic. Multi-omic studies have unveiled the vast complexity of changes occurring over decades in the brains of individuals as various AD hallmark pathologies emerge.6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 Typically, systems-level omic studies cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships. However, by combining strong correlational inference with omics obtained from different AD stages, we can generate hypotheses regarding causality or the role of these changes in the disease. To determine whether omic-level changes play a fundamental role in pathogenesis, it is essential to (1) compare the data across related disorders and disease models, (2) integrate the data with genetic risk and biomarker information, and (3) directly manipulate the levels of the altered proteins or RNAs in various model systems to observe their impact on pathophysiology potentially relevant to human AD. Here, we performed quantitative tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS)-based proteomic analyses of the brains from CRND8 mice24 at various ages and compared these findings to brain proteome data from 5XFAD mice25 and human AD, asymptomatic AD (AsymAD, i.e., individuals with neuropathologic criteria of AD but normal cognition before death), and control brain from multiple cohorts.8,26,27 We find robust, highly significant, correlations in global proteome changes in human AD and AsymAD brains compared to the transgenic (Tg) mouse models and both conserved and divergent network module changes. Proteins that map to the conserved M42 matrisome module accumulate in Aβ plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid (CAA), and/or dystrophic neuronal processes with overexpression of midkine (Mdk) and pleiotrophin (PTN) in CRND8 mice leading to accelerated accumulation of Aβ in plaques and CAA. M42 proteins exhibit binding to fibrillar Aβ and non-human amyloid fibrils in vitro, and both MDK and PTN co-accumulate in cardiac transthyretin (TTR) amyloid. This contextualized understanding of AD proteomic changes and their interplay with amyloid deposition provides valuable insights into AD pathogenesis. More specifically, they suggest that antagonizing MDK and/or PTN binding to amyloid could be a therapeutic strategy.",
        "conclusion": "Integrating newly generated deep proteomic data from CRND8 mice brains with large-scale proteomic data from human AD brain, we define an extensive Aβ/Aβ amyloid “responsome” conserved between two mouse models of Aβ deposition and human AD.8,9,26,27,28 Select DEPs and protein modules show increased age dependence in magnitude of change as more Aβ amyloid accumulates, a progression observed when comparing AsymAD to AD. DEPs and overall protein changes are concordant between mouse and human in some modules but not others, reinforcing the concept that APP Tg mice are incomplete AD models.8,9,34 Thus, we establish a paradigm for contextualizing proteomic changes that occur in human AD and provide insights into how well a model system reflects the proteomic changes in the human AD brain. These data suggest that a comparative omics network approach can provide a less biased insight into what makes a good disease model.69,70 CRND8 mice do not show overt neuronal loss.24 The finding that numerous modules relating to neuronal and synaptic function (M1, M4, M5, M22, and M33) show conservation is intriguing. Numerous APP models, including CRND8 mice, have been shown to have synaptic alterations,71,72,73 and in many cases, these alterations occur at early ages.69,74,75 Neuritin and small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein β, implicated in cognitive resilience to AD pathologies, are both consistently downregulated DEPs in the older CRND8 cohorts.76,77 Nevertheless, these mouse models do not progress to an overt neurodegenerative state and lack neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Future studies contextualizing additional protein networks will deepen our understanding of the proteomic changes in mouse models that mimic human AD with additional proteomic studies on tau mice possibly identifying modules related to NFT pathology. We should consider that discordant modules in mice, such as M9 (Golgi), might serve protective functions that could alter the appearance of downstream pathologies and overt neurodegeneration in the models.78,79 Building deep TMT-MS proteome from the human AD brain required hundreds of samples8,9; in contrast, using small cohorts of CRND8 or 5XFAD mice, we can generate highly reproducible data.13,33 From a translational point of view, these data suggest that preclinical studies in amyloid deposition models should more routinely be evaluated using systems-level proteomics including assessments of how a given intervention impacts the proteome in older mice with extensive amyloid deposition given these mice appear to better reflect the human AD proteome. Previous studies established that several M42 proteins accumulate in amyloid plaques.80,81,82,83,84 Here, we provide additional evidence that many additional M42 module proteins are present in plaques. A subset of these proteins is found in CAA, others in dystrophic processes around plaques, and others in reactive astrocytes. These studies broadly serve as a strong affirmation of the power of WGCNA to inform the pathobiology of a complex disease.85 Indeed, these validation studies highlight the direct links between module M42 and amyloid pathology.8,9 Nuanced data emerging from these validation studies relate to the unique patterns of localization of these proteins within plaques and CAA. Such data along with data showing that only a subset of parenchymal plaque-associated proteins is detected in CAA raise questions about the differences between CAA and plaque amyloid and the heterogeneity of proteins within individual fibrillar plaques. Direct studies of the human CAA proteome have also found increased levels of OLFML3, PTN, and HTR1A, along with other known CAA components (e.g., APOE, CLU, and APCS).86,87,88 CAA and CADASIL vessels’ proteomes show overlap with each other and broad overlap with many M42+ DEPs.86,89 Sequestration of HTRA1 with NOTCH3 in CADASIL has been proposed to lead HTRA1 loss of function and accumulation of HTRA1 substrates,86,89 possibly mechanistically linking CADASIL to its autosomal recessive phenocopy cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, which is caused by heterozygous loss of function mutations in HTRA1. By inference, these data showing Htra1 in CAA have mechanistic implications for CAA-driven vascular dysfunction in AD. Overexpression studies of Mdk or PTN in the CRND8 brain result in increased CAA and parenchymal Aβ amyloid, demonstrating these proteins have a direct impact on amyloid deposition and represent novel therapeutic targets in AD. As both proteins accelerate aggregation of Aβ and bind preexisting amyloid fibrils in vitro, we hypothesize they act as amyloid chaperones likely directly impacting the rate of Aβ aggregation. However, Mdk also impacts myeloid cells, and its co-accumulation in plaques could impact microglial-mediated clearance either through gain or loss of function.90,91 Ptn, which signals through the same receptors as Mdk, could have similar impacts.92 Thus, these proteins may also influence cell-mediated clearance of Aβ. Additional studies will be needed to evaluate the impact of Mdk and Ptn and the many co-accumulating proteins on amyloid deposition and peri-plaque cellular responses. Though a previous study had claimed that a Mdk knockout crossed into an APP Tg line resulted in increased amyloid, these data are anecdotal and not rigorous.93 Non-Tg mice Mdk and Ptn knockouts were also studied and claimed to increase amyloid deposition, but in that study, an antibody selective for human Aβ was used to stain “plaques”; these results are likely artifactual. HS and HSPGs and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) have been implicated in the biology of AD and other amyloid deposits.94 HS and select HSPG core proteins (e.g., HSPG2 and ACAN) accumulate in plaques and DNs. Select HSPGs also accelerate Aβ aggregation and mediate the internalization of extracellular tau.95 Though we detect HSPG2, ACAN, and CSPGs, they are minimally altered (Table S1). In contrast, in human AD, the HSPGs, GPC4, 5, SPOCK1–3, and SDC2, 4 are much more robust DEPs and several are also core M42 module members. In CRND8 mice, Gpc1, 5, Spock1–3, and Sdc2, 4 are also robust DEPs (Table S1). Most M42+ proteins assayed here bind Aβ42 amyloid and non-human, non-homologous amyloid fibrils.42,43 These data led us to explore whether MDK and PTN might be components of peripheral amyloids and both accumulate in TTR cardiac amyloid. Neither has been previously detected, even in laser-capture proteomic studies of cardiac amyloid deposits.96 As HS/HSPGs are common components of human amyloids, these studies suggest that there may be very complex multipartite structural interactions between amyloid, HS/HSPGs, and these co-accumulating proteins. Given intensive studies of both Aβ amyloid and peripheral amyloids, it is somewhat surprising that we and others are documenting additional proteins co-accumulating with amyloid.13,32,33,96,97 In our studies, brain tissue was extracted with 8M urea; thus, we are studying the total detectable urea-solubilized proteome and not the detergent-insoluble proteome. Indeed, for Mdk and Ptn in mice brains, we find no gross change in solubility, despite the large increase in the Tg mouse brains. These initial solubility studies likely explain why many of these proteins are not detected in detergent-insoluble fractions typically used to isolate amyloid; they simply may not be there. Our current data and data from others reveal numerous proteins that co-deposit with Aβ amyloid. Further, given the large number of proteins showing age-progressive increases in the CRND8 mice brain, it is highly likely that over time many additional proteins will be found to accumulate with Aβ amyloid or in cellular processes around plaques and in other amyloid diseases. Two recently identified components of Aβ plaques, Pycard and Mfge8, are increased DEPs in our data, but in 18-month CRND8, they rank 296th and 300th among all the increased DEPs in terms of log2FC.98,99 In the human AD proteome, PYCARD is significantly increased (log2FC = 0.06), and MFGE8 is detected but not increased. There is ongoing debate as to how amyloid or Aβ aggregate pathology drives cellular dysfunction and degeneration in AD.2,6,7 More generally, this debate extends to all amyloid disorders and how amyloid accumulation causes tissue damage and organ dysfunction.39,47,100 Indeed, extensive efforts have been made to identify toxic species or conformers.101 Our current data and previous studies of proteins that co-accumulate with amyloid offer an alternative hypothesis to the concept that amyloid or amyloid-like aggregate is directly toxic.75,102 We term this the “amyloid scaffold” hypothesis (Figure S12) and posit that if amyloid deposits scaffold the accumulation of numerous proteins, then perhaps the accumulation of these proteins mediates downstream pathophysiology. Many of the proteins detected in plaques and CAA are known signaling molecules, and their accumulation could impact dystrophic neurite and reactive glia in the local plaque microenvironment or cells in the vessel wall. Accumulation of proteins within amyloid deposits could lead to a gain of normal function, if these proteins retain activity. Such binding may also activate novel signaling pathways. Sequestration could also result in loss of function and reduced levels in the surrounding tissue. In the heart, MDK can promote intimal hyperplasia whereas PTN has been shown to have angiogenic effects.103,104,105 Thus, this hypothesis may have relevance for peripheral amyloidoses as well. There are also intriguing parallels between this concept of amyloid as a scaffold in disease and functional amyloids, which have been proposed to mediate biological effects in part through a scaffolding mechanism (reviewed in the study by Rubel et al.106). It is important to consider that the accumulation of proteins in the plaque is not simply a bystander effect, but part of the response to amyloid as a danger-associated molecular pattern.107,108 The amyloid “scaffold” and amyloid (or oligomer) as “direct toxin” hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.34,75 Many proteins that interact with amyloid may be involved in clearance, coating, and neutralization of the structure to reduce toxicity, or some combination of these. Other components may simply be bystanders, at least concerning impacts on amyloid deposition, but once present, they could still mediate pathology by altering signaling gradients. There is extensive data that APOE and CLU interaction with Aβ/Aβ amyloid deposits alters the local cellular response and influences amyloid deposition.80,81,82,109,110 Because of their genetic association with AD, they are also considered therapeutic targets.111 We have not yet explored studies in knockout mice; however, overexpression studies suggest that Mdk and PTN, like APOE and CLU, can increase amyloid deposition and both also increase CAA. Thus, like APOE and CLU, they represent possibly therapeutic targets. It will be intriguing to evaluate the impacts of the larger set of proteins that are now being shown to co-accumulate. We speculate that some will promote amyloid deposition, others block it, and still others simply bind without altering deposition. Additional probes of M42+ proteins’ biology will be necessary to determine their role in AD and their druggability. Integrating data from genetic studies of AD and CSF biomarkers reinforces links between many established AD genes or prioritized genetic loci and AD risk genes and regulation of Aβ catabolism and deposition or response to Aβ deposition and suggests that select CSF biomarkers might reflect the impacts of amyloid pathology in AD. Recently, SMOC1 and SPON1, two core M42 members, are altered in concert with decreases in Aβ42/40 ratios in the CSF of individuals with dominantly inherited AD.63 Further, Smoc1 is a highly reproducible, highly upregulated AD CSF biomarker.59,63,67,112 In summary, this contextualized understanding of AD and APP mouse model proteomic changes provides insights into the molecular complexity of AD pathogenesis and informs biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets related to amyloid deposition. Though we have (1) validated some of the more robust protein changes in the proteomic analyses, (2) provided pathological insight related to a subset of these proteins, and (3) generated initial modeling and biochemical data to support potential pathobiological roles, there is still much to be learned about amyloid and its role in AD pathophysiology and other amyloid disorders. Future integrative omic studies can build on and refine these current studies, especially by incorporating models of additional pathologies relevant to AD and other amyloidoses."

        "abstract": "Nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic accumulations of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are pathological hallmarks in almost all patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and up to 50% of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, TDP-43 pathology is predominantly observed in the limbic system and correlates with cognitive decline and reduced hippocampal volume. Disruption of nuclear TDP-43 function leads to abnormal RNA splicing and incorporation of erroneous cryptic exons in numerous transcripts including Stathmin-2 (STMN2, also known as SCG10) and UNC13A, recently reported in tissues from patients with ALS and FTD. Here, we identify both STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons in Alzheimer's disease patients, that correlate with TDP-43 pathology burden, but not with amyloid-β or tau deposits. We also demonstrate that processing of the STMN2 pre-mRNA is more sensitive to TDP-43 loss of function than UNC13A. In addition, full-length RNAs encoding STMN2 and UNC13A are suppressed in large RNA-seq datasets generated from Alzheimer's disease post-mortem brain tissue. Collectively, these results open exciting new avenues to use STMN2 and UNC13A as potential therapeutic targets in a broad range of neurodegenerative conditions with TDP-43 proteinopathy including Alzheimer's disease.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affecting up to 30% of the population over 65 . Genetic and pathological studies have provided overwhelming evidence that Alzheimer’s disease has a heterogeneous etiology, thus a better characterization of patient subgroups is essential. Extracellular deposits of amyloid-β plaques, and intraneuronal accumulations of neurofibrillary tau tangles are canonical hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease pathology . Cytoplasmic inclusions of phosphorylated TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) [6, 20, 48, 53, 66–68, 81]. Notably, TDP-43 proteinopathy has also been reported in approximately one-third of Alzheimer’s disease cases, with estimates varying from 19 to 57% , also referred to as Alzheimer’s disease with LATE neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) . TDP-43 pathology burden in Alzheimer’s disease follows a stereotypic spread, starting in the amygdala and entorhinal cortex, with progression through stages that correlates with a decrease in cognition and hippocampal volume . Moreover, TDP-43 pathology in Alzheimer’s disease is associated with loss of cognitive resilience, higher odds of clinical dementia diagnosis , and faster brain atrophy rates . While disruption of TDP-43 defines a distinct subgroup of Alzheimer’s disease patients, the impact of TDP-43 pathology and its associated loss of function remains largely unexplored in this condition. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein encoded by the TARDBP gene that regulates fundamental aspects of RNA metabolism including splicing . In normal conditions, TDP-43 is mainly nuclear and represses the inclusion of mostly non-conserved cryptic exons . In disease, TDP-43 is cleared from the nucleus and accumulates in phosphorylated and poly-ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions . Loss of TDP-43 nuclear function leads to the aberrant incorporation of cryptic exons into messenger RNAs, which are detectable in tissues from patients with ALS , FTD , and Alzheimer’s disease . We and others have identified that the human RNA most affected by TDP-43 disruption encodes a neuronal protein called stathmin-2 (STMN2, also known as SCG10) . Indeed, TDP-43 is required to prevent the inclusion of a cryptic exon within the first intron of STMN2 pre-mRNA. Abnormal inclusion of this cryptic exon and usage of a premature polyadenylation signal produces a non-functional truncated mRNA, leading to a striking loss of stathmin-2 protein . Misprocessing of STMN2 is detected in post-mortem tissues of patients with sporadic and familial forms of ALS and FTD . Remarkably, disruption of STMN2 mRNA is critical for neuronal dysfunction caused by TDP-43 nuclear loss-of-function. Restoring STMN2 protein levels either by lentivirus-mediated expression of STMN2 or by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO)-mediated steric blockage of STMN2 misprocessing rescues axonal regeneration and transport defects in iPSC derived human motor neurons depleted for TDP-43 . In addition, germline deletion of Stmn2 in mice or chronic reduction of Stmn2 in the nervous system of otherwise normal adult mice leads to motor deficits with denervation of the neuromuscular junctions that recapitulate clinical manifestations observed in patients with ALS. Hence, restoration of stathmin-2, including with ASOs that sterically block the abnormal splicing , emerges as an attractive therapeutic strategy in TDP-43 proteinopathies. Recently the transcript encoding UNC13A, a synaptic protein essential for neurotransmission , was also shown to be mis-spliced in ALS and FTD . Loss of TDP-43 leads to the abnormal inclusion of a cryptic exon between exon 20 and 21 of the UNC13A transcript that results in a premature stop codon and nonsense-mediated decay of UNC13A RNA. Interestingly, non-coding polymorphisms within the UNC13A gene previously associated with an increased risk of ALS were shown to reduce the affinity of TDP-43 for UNC13A RNA and perturb splicing repression of this intronic region . Here, we titrated different levels of TDP-43 downregulation within human neuroblastoma cells to determine the sensitivity of STMN2 and UNC13A pre-mRNA processing to TDP-43 loss. We also show, that both STMN2 and UNC13A RNAs are mis-spliced in the amygdala and entorhinal cortex of a substantial fraction of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. We demonstrate, for the first time, that accumulation of STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons correlates with TDP-43 pathology in Alzheimer’s disease, independently of amyloid-β or tau pathological burden. Similarly, our analysis of large RNA-seq datasets from post-mortem tissues also unravels the disruption of STMN2 and UNC13A in Alzheimer’s disease patients. These results highlight the potential of TDP-43-dependent splicing alterations as molecular markers to subgroup Alzheimer’s disease patients. Importantly, ongoing efforts to develop therapeutic strategies preventing TDP-43-associated splicing defects may benefit patients with a range of neurological conditions including ALS, FTD and Alzheimer’s disease.",
        "conclusion": "Alzheimer’s disease is a heterogenous disease, and precision medicine approaches to fine-tune diagnosis and treatment offer real promise for patients. TDP-43 pathology co-occurs with Alzheimer’s disease in a subset of patients, which is also termed Alzheimer’s disease with LATE-NC, likely contributing to neural system dysfunction in those patients. Indeed, TDP-43 pathology in Alzheimer’s disease is associated with more severe cognitive decline and neurodegeneration [17, 18, 32–34, 36, 37, 99], underscoring the need to stratify Alzheimer’s disease patients according to their TDP-43 pathology status. In addition, the higher likelihood of TDP-43 lesions in patients with typical Alzheimer’s disease pathology compared to the general population raises the question of whether there are synergistic or underlying genetic or environmental factors that contribute to both Alzheimer’s disease and TDP-43 pathology, but this is currently unknown. Notably, TDP-43 pathology has also been described in limbic regions of older patients with and without dementia (LATE-NC) who lack tau and amyloid-β pathologies . Our results support the use of TDP-43-dependent splicing alterations to sub-categorize patients with respect to TDP-43 dysfunction. RNA-seq has been used before to demonstrate disease-specific splicing alterations in Alzheimer’s disease . Recent reports have detected cryptic exons by using qRT-PCR or RT-PCR in post-mortem tissues from patients with Alzheimer’s disease . Our study extends on those findings by demonstrating that STMN2 and UNC13A disruption from TDP-43 loss-of-function is detected in large RNA-seq datasets and can distinguish between Alzheimer’s disease patients with and without TDP-43 pathology. Notably, previous studies observed a non-significant tendency for decreased levels of full-length STMN2 RNA in the temporal cortex and hippocampus of a subset of patients with Alzheimer’s disease , as well as a decrease in STMN2 RNA in inhibitory neurons and oligodendrocytes of Alzheimer’s disease patients . Although these studies did not correlate the transcriptional changes to TDP-43 pathology, they independently confirm STMN2 as a relevant mechanistic disease target. Importantly, we now demonstrate that cryptic exon detection correlates with TDP-43 burden, but not with amyloid-β and tau in the amygdala of Alzheimer’s disease patients. TDP-43 pathology follows a stereotypic spread as Alzheimer’s disease progress , and we observe that STMN2 and UNC13A are indeed significantly disrupted in temporal cortex of patients with high Braak stages. The STMN2 cryptic exon was detected in most of the cases with phosphorylated TD-43 aggregates except for 3 out of 21 tissues tested. Although we cannot exclude that additional protective factors (genetic or environmental) may prevent mis-processing of RNA targets in a subset of patients, it is noteworthy that, in a given brain region, TDP-43 pathology is spatially heterogeneous and expression of cryptic exons may be below the detection limit in the assessed tissue sample. Inversely, STMN2 cryptic exon was detected in 2 out of 17 brains without apparent phosphorylated TDP-43 aggregates which is consistent with reports of TDP-43 nuclear loss without cytoplasmic aggregates in a subset of patients with FTD or Alzheimer’s disease . Our systematic analysis indicates that STMN2 is more sensitive than UNC13A to decrease in TDP-43 levels; whereas, a more robust TDP-43 suppression is necessary to observe the dose response of UNC13A cryptic exon generation. This is consistent with previous observation that depletion of at least 50% of TDP-43 encoding RNA was required to induce UNC13A RNA mis-splicing ; whereas, STMN2 mis-processing is triggered by less than 30% reduction of TDP-43 . In addition, cryptic exons are more commonly identified in STMN2 than UNC13A within post-mortem tissues from patients with either ALS and/or FTD . Our RNA-seq analysis also shows that the STMN2 cryptic exon is enriched in tissues of Alzheimer’s disease; whereas, no significant enrichment of UNC13A cryptic exon was detected. STMN2 expression levels are tenfold higher than UNC13A both in SH-SY5Y cells and human tissues, with STMN2 being among the 25 most expressed genes in laser-microdissected human motor neurons , which may contribute to the differential detection of STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons. In addition, UNC13A cryptic exon-containing transcripts might escape detection due to a shorter half-life since they are subjected to nonsense-mediated decay while STMN2 truncated transcripts are not . However, we propose that the higher detection of STMN2 cryptic exons is also due to an intrinsic different vulnerability of STMN2 and UNC13A transcripts to TDP-43 loss of function. Indeed, the binding pattern of TDP-43 on STMN2 and UNC13A pre-mRNAs is distinct, with a narrow binding site consisting of 3 ugugug motifs over 22 bp in the cryptic exon (exon 2a) of STMN2 ; whereas, TDP-43 binds an 800 bp-long ug-rich region in intron 20 of UNC13A . In addition, hnRNP L was recently found to mitigate the impact of TDP-43 loss on UNC13A splicing . In contrast, we show that hnRNP L does not repress the inclusion of STMN2 cryptic exon. Identification of STMN2 and UNC13A disruption in Alzheimer’s disease has major implications: (1) they are both enriched in the brain, (2) they have crucial roles in maintaining neuronal function and (3) they are two prominent targets of TDP-43 for which therapeutic approaches are in development . STMN2 is a tubulin-binding protein important for axonal maintenance and regeneration after injury . Loss of STMN2 in vivo leads to motor and sensory behavioural deficits, as well as denervation of neuromuscular junctions . Finally, even though many RNAs are affected by TDP-43 loss-of-function , restoring STMN2 levels alone is sufficient to rescue axonal transport defects and the ability of iPSC-derived motor neurons to regrow after axotomy . UNC13A has been extensively linked to synaptic function, and it is essential for neurotransmission . As such, both STMN2 and UNC13A are important components of neuronal function, and given the lack of cognitive resilience and increased brain atrophies associated with TDP-43 pathology in Alzheimer’s disease , future studies should focus on exploring how these targets may contribute to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease. Importantly, strategies to either target TDP-43 cellular mislocalization or to prevent cryptic splicing of specific TDP-43 targets are emerging for clinical development in neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 proteinopathy. Indeed, the usage of ASOs chemically modified to alter pre-mRNA splicing without recruiting RNase H is an approved standard of care for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and has become an attractive therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases . We recently demonstrated the ability of steric binding ASOs to prevent mis-splicing and restore stathmin-2 protein level in TDP-43 deficient neurons and mouse brain , providing support for restoration of STMN2 as a potential therapeutic approach in TDP-43 proteinopathies. Collectively, this further supports the use of cryptic exons to stratify Alzheimer’s disease patients to enable the development of targeted therapies. It is noteworthy that approaches are also emerging to use TDP-43-dependent splicing alterations as potential biomarkers in patients with TDP-43 proteinopathy. Indeed, while PET imaging for TDP-43 pathology is not available and detection of pathological TDP-43 in biofluids has yielded conflicting results , recent studies show the feasibility of detecting aberrant peptides generated from TDP-43-dependent cryptic splicing in CSF of patients with ALS/FTD . Even though there are not yet reliable biomarkers based on the detection of STMN2 or UNC13A cryptic exons, development of these approaches may have ground-breaking implications for subcategorization of patients and the development of personalized therapeutics in TDP-43 proteinopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease."

        "title": "The Alzheimer's Disease Gene SORL1 Regulates Lysosome Function in Human Microglia.",
        "abstract": "The SORL1 gene encodes the sortilin-related receptor protein SORLA, a sorting receptor that regulates endo-lysosomal trafficking of various substrates. Loss of function variants in SORL1 are causative for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and decreased expression of SORLA has been repeatedly observed in human AD brains. SORL1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, including in microglia, the tissue-resident immune cells of the brain. Loss of SORLA leads to enlarged lysosomes in hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells (hMGLs). However, how SORLA deficiency contributes to lysosomal dysfunction in microglia and how this contributes to AD pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we show that loss of SORLA results in decreased lysosomal degradation and lysosomal enzyme activity due to altered trafficking of lysosomal enzymes in hMGLs. Phagocytic uptake of fibrillar amyloid beta 1-42 and synaptosomes is increased in SORLA-deficient hMGLs, but due to reduced lysosomal degradation, these substrates aberrantly accumulate in lysosomes. An alternative mechanism of lysosome clearance, lysosomal exocytosis, is also impaired in SORL1-deficient microglia, which may contribute to an altered immune response. Overall, these data suggest that SORLA has an important role in the proper trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases in hMGLs, which is critical for microglial function. This further substantiates the microglial endo-lysosomal network as a potential novel pathway through which SORL1 may increase AD risk and contribute to the development of AD. Additionally, our findings may inform the development of novel lysosome and microglia-associated drug targets for AD.",

        "introduction": "Treatments for Alzheimer's disease (ad), a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia (“2023 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures,” 2023), are few and do not alter the course of disease progression by more than several months. Hallmarks of ad include extracellular Amyloid‐beta (Aβ) accumulation in senile plaques, intracellular aggregation of tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Microglia, tissue‐resident phagocytes of the brain, are key effectors of pathogenic protein clearance and maintenance of neuronal health and brain homeostasis in general, positioning this brain cell type at the center of cellular responses in ad pathogenesis and making it an attractive target for new ad therapies. Identification of ad risk genes highly expressed in microglia by genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) further supports the idea that dysfunctional microglia may contribute to onset and/or progression of ad (Maninger et al. 2024; McQuade and Blurton‐Jones 2019). Collective evidence from murine models and post‐mortem human ad brain tissue has revealed that microglia migrate to and cluster around Aβ plaques (Akiyama et al. 1999; Bolmont et al. 2008; Itagaki et al. 1989; Meyer‐Luehmann et al. 2008; Stalder et al. 1999) but are unable to eliminate these toxic deposits from the brain. One mechanism that may cause this defect is lysosome dysfunction in microglia. Abnormal lysosomes in microglia can negatively alter phagocytic and inflammatory responses (Iyer et al. 2022; Lancaster et al. 2021; Quick et al. 2023; Ren et al. 2022), functions known to cause neuroinflammation in ad, substantiating the need to investigate microglia‐specific lysosomal pathways as therapeutic targets. Our previous work has shown that loss of the intracellular sorting receptor and potent ad risk gene, Sortilin‐related receptor‐1 (SORL1), that encodes the multidomain protein SORLA, results in enlarged lysosomes in hMGLs (Mishra 2024). SORLA is a hybrid receptor that belongs to both the LDLR and the VPS10p receptor family. It interacts with the multi‐protein assembly retromer and shuttles proteins between TGN, endosomes, and the cell surface (Fjorback et al. 2012; Jacobsen et al. 2001, 1996; Willnow and Andersen 2013; Yamazaki et al. 1996). In particular, retromer and its receptors, SORLA and the cation‐independent mannose‐6 phosphate receptor (CIMPR), function to traffic mature lysosomal hydrolases from the TGN via endosomes to lysosomes (Cui et al. 2019; Hasanagic et al. 2015; Nielsen et al. 2007). Genetic, epidemiological, and functional studies have now cumulatively and unequivocally established SORL1 as a gene that increases the risk for ad, highlighting aberrant endo‐lysosomal trafficking as an important pathway in ad pathogenesis (Holstege et al. 2017, 2023; Kunkle et al. 2017; Lambert et al. 2013; Rogaeva et al. 2007; Scheltens et al. 2021). Loss of SORLA expression has been observed in ad brains in the early stages of the disorder (Dodson et al. 2006; Scherzer et al. 2004; Thonberg et al. 2017). Studies investigating the role of SORLA in ad pathogenesis have extensively focused on neurons and revealed that loss of SORLA causes endo‐lysosomal defects in neurons, specifically in endosomal recycling, autophagy, and lysosome function, ultimately resulting in increased secretion of toxic Aβ species and impaired synaptic activity in neurons (Andersen et al. 2022; Hung et al. 2021; Knupp et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2023; Mishra et al. 2023, 2022). While SORL1 mRNA is highly expressed in microglia, even more so than in neurons and astrocytes (Lee et al. 2023; Olah et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2016), the impact of loss of SORLA function specifically in microglia is not well‐studied, rendering our understanding of the role of SORLA in ad risk incomplete at best. Understanding cell‐type‐specific functions of ad risk genes, including SORLA, is imperative in understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease and in developing rational therapeutic approaches for ad. In this study, we investigated how SORLA deficiency affects lysosomal function in hiPSC‐derived microglia‐like cells (hMGLs). We used quantitative flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and functional enzymatic and cellular assays to reveal that SORL1 KO hMGLs show decreased lysosomal degradation and reduced lysosomal enzymatic activity due to impaired trafficking of lysosomal enzymes from the trans‐Golgi network (TGN) to lysosomes. We show that the main retromer cargo that functions with SORL1 to traffic lysosomal enzymes, CIMPR, has reduced expression in SORL1‐deficient hMGLs and reduced co‐localization with enzymes in lysosomes. This impairment in enzyme trafficking leads to inefficient lysosomal degradation and accumulation of phagocytosed fibrillar Aβ 1–42 and synaptosomes in lysosomes. Impaired degradation leads to lysosomal stress and could prompt cells to rid themselves of undigested cargo via other mechanisms (Domingues et al. 2024; Wang, Telpoukhovskaia, et al. 2018; Zhong et al. 2023). We tested lysosomal exocytosis (LE), a secretory pathway through which microglia release lysosomal enzymes, cargo, and inflammatory cytokines into the extracellular environment and found that this process is also altered in SORL1 KO hMGLs. Overall, our data show that SORL1 regulates lysosomal homeostasis in human microglia. Loss of normal SORL1 function leads to mis‐trafficking of lysosomal enzymes and impairment of critical lysosomal functions, including substrate degradation and LE. This data, along with recent work describing a role of SORLA in sorting neuroimmune receptors (Ovesen et al. 2024), adds to a growing body of work highlighting SORL1 and related pathways as novel therapeutic targets for ad.",
        "conclusion": "Despite extensive evidence that loss‐of‐function variants in the SORL1 gene and SORL1 haploinsufficiency are causative for ad (Campion et al. 2019; Holstege et al. 2017; Nicolas et al. 2016; Pottier et al. 2012; Verheijen et al. 2016), developing therapeutic interventions targeting SORL1 has been challenging, partly because cell‐type‐specific mechanisms through which loss of SORL1 may increase risk for ad remain unclear. Indeed, recent RNA sequencing data highlight that certain CNS cells undergo more changes than others in response to SORL1 KO (Lee et al. 2023). Recent work from our group and others has shown that depletion of SORLA in neurons leads to enlarged early endosomes, impairments in endo‐lysosomal trafficking, changes in gene expression, and impaired neuronal function (Hung et al. 2021; Knupp et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2023; Mishra et al. 2023, 2022). Despite this extensive characterization in neurons, very little is currently understood about SORLA function in human microglia. Our previous work suggests that there may be important cell‐type‐specific differences in endo‐lysosomal organelles affected by loss of SORLA. We did not observe differences in the size of early endosomes between SORL1 WT and SORL1 KO hMGLs (Knupp et al. 2020) but have documented lysosomal enlargement in SORL1 KO microglia (Mishra 2024). Here we provide evidence for the role of SORLA in regulating lysosome function in human microglia. We show that loss of SORLA causes mistrafficking of lysosomal enzymes, leading to impaired lysosomal degradation and accumulation of substrates in lysosomes. Alternate pathways to release lysosomal cargo from cells, such as LE, are also impaired. This impairment contributes to a blunted neuroimmune response. SORLA binds to retromer (Fjorback et al. 2012), which regulates the retrograde transport of the cation‐independent mannose‐6‐phosphate receptor (CIMPR) through the mannose‐6‐phosphate‐dependent pathway (M6P) (Arighi et al. 2004; Cui et al. 2019). The CIMPR is a key receptor that traffics lysosomal enzymes from the TGN to the lysosomes (Braulke and Bonifacino 2009; Braulke et al. 2023). In the absence of SORLA, there is reduced expression and reduced localization of CIMPR in late endosomes and lysosomes, suggesting that this crucial pathway for the delivery of lysosomal hydrolases is impaired in SORL1 KO hMGLs. During the process of lysosomal enzyme trafficking to the late endosomes and lysosomes, CIMPR forms a complex with premature lysosomal enzymes at the TGN, is transported to the early endosomes, and then directed towards the lysosomes (Hasanagic et al. 2015). Given that we do not see any difference in the localization of this receptor at the TGN but reduced localization at the late endosomes and lysosomes, it is conceivable that CIMPR gets stuck in the early endosomes during lysosomal enzyme trafficking in the absence of SORLA. In support of this idea, it has been shown in immortalized neuroblastoma and epithelial cell lines that SORLA can bind to the cytosolic adaptor protein, phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 (PACS1) (Burgert et al. 2013) which is known to direct retrograde TGN retrieval of CIMPR (Chen et al. 1997; Scott et al. 2006; Wan et al. 1998) and can participate in PACS1‐dependent sorting of Cathepsin B (Burgert et al. 2013; Nielsen et al. 2007). However, whether SORLA directly binds to CIMPR and the precise role of SORLA in the M6P‐dependent pathway in microglia warrants further investigation. We did not observe significant differences in total protein or changes in pro versus mature forms of lysosomal enzymes (Figure 2D–F). One explanation for this observation could be that there are different ratios of pro versus mature forms of these enzymes in other compartments (such as endosomes) or that there is leakage of mature enzymes from the lysosome to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, proteomic analyses have variability in the expression of lysosomal enzymes from SORL1‐deficient microglia, in one case showing no change (Lee et al. 2023) and in another showing decreased expression, although the majority of this decrease was reported from a cell line with a missense variant in the VPS10 domain of SORL1 (Liu et al. 2020). Impaired degradation in SORLA deficient hMGLs affects the fate of phagocytosed substrates. We observed increased internalization of various substrates including transferrin, fAβ, and synaptosomes (Figure S5). Interestingly, we did not see a change in phagocytosis of oAβ, which replicates recently published work (Ovesen et al. 2024). The impact of increased phagocytosis of synaptosomes could contribute to excessive synaptic pruning and eventual synaptic loss observed in ad, but increased uptake of fAβ may be a means to reduce amyloidogenic burden. SORLA is known to regulate receptor protein homoeostasis at the cell surface by modulating intracellular sorting of receptors to the TGN and endo‐lysosomal compartments (Pietilä et al. 2019; Schmidt et al. 2017). We observed increased cell surface localization of the phagocytic receptors P2Y6 and TREM2 (Figure S5) which may explain the increased internalization of certain substrates. Another recent study observed increased expression of the ad risk gene BIN1 in SORL1 KO hMGLs (Lee et al. 2023), which may also lead to increased phagocytosis (Sudwarts et al. 2022). Liu et al. observed expression changes in phagocytic receptors in SORL1 deficient hMGLs including TREM2 and ITGB2, a receptor involved in the phagocytosis of both Aβ and synaptosomes (Liu et al. 2020). However, in their study, Liu et al. observed deficient phagocytosis of oligomeric Aβ, although the assay did not distinguish between phagocytic uptake and substrate degradation. Mechanisms of phagocytic uptake by microglia can also differ significantly depending on the protein conformation of Aβ (Lee et al. 2023; Pan et al. 2011; Ries and Sastre 2016; Sudwarts et al. 2022). Together, this data suggests that loss of SORL1 expression may change localization of phagocytic receptors and genes involved in phagocytosis of specific substrates. While we observe increased phagocytic uptake of both fAβ and synaptosomes, these substrates were not degraded; therefore, a crucial aspect of the normal phagocytic process in SORL1 KO hMGLs is impaired, leading to their intracellular accumulation. This may ultimately increase lysosomal stress in microglia and contribute to lysosomal dysfunction seen in ad. Indeed, the role of SORLA in microglial phagocytosis may act as a “double‐edged sword,” functioning in both a disease‐stage‐specific and context‐dependent manner. LE is used by microglia to release cytokines, enzymes, and cargo into the extracellular space (Dou et al. 2012; Jacquet et al. 2024; Kreher et al. 2021). LE is a calcium‐regulated process that expels lysosomal contents into the extracellular space (Buratta et al. 2020; Tancini et al. 2020). LE is important for such activities as remodeling of the extracellular matrix and, in the case of immune cells, releasing contents to degrade pathogenic material (Ireton et al. 2018; Miao et al. 2015). We found that SORL1 KO hMGLs show reduced LE as evidenced by reduced LAMP1 localization on the plasma membrane and reduced enzyme activity in the conditioned medium of hMGLs after treatment with a stimulus. Thus, the increased accumulation of substrates in lysosomes may also indicate a failure to release these substrates via LE. Interestingly, in response to acute stress, LE can be used to release pro‐inflammatory cytokines, bypassing the slower, more conventional secretory pathway (Aiello et al. 2020). We observed that calcimycin‐induced LE can release IL‐1β and IL‐6, with the IL‐6 response being reduced in SORL1 KO hMGLs. We also observed a blunted cytokine release in response to canonical pro‐inflammatory stimuli, LPS, and IFNγ, consistent with other recent reports in SORLA‐deficient hMGLs (Ovesen et al. 2024), suggesting that multiple mechanisms may govern SORLA‐mediated cytokine release in hMGLs. In summary, our study highlights lysosome dysfunction in microglia as a pathway through which SORL1 loss of function may increase the risk for ad. Our data identify a previously unexplored cell‐type‐specific mechanism through which SORL1 can regulate the endo‐lysosomal pathway beyond its well‐established function as a sorting receptor for APP in neurons, illustrating the importance of exploring this multifaceted sorting receptor and potent ad risk factor as a therapeutic target for ad."

While Mendelian randomization (MR) can mitigate these biases using protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) as instrumental variables, some pQTLs violate core assumptions, leading to biased conclusions. To address this, we propose MR-SPI, a novel MR method that selects valid pQTL instruments using Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina principle and performs robust post-selection inference. Integrating MR-SPI with AlphaFold3, we developed a computational pipeline to identify causal protein biomarkers and predict 3D structural changes.

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stands as the primary cause of dementia globally, exerting a considerable strain on healthcare resources.1,2 Despite extensive efforts, the etiology and pathogenesis of AD are still unclear, and strategies aimed at impeding or delaying its clinical advancement have largely remained challenging to achieve.1,3,4 The amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that AD begins with the accumulation and aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in the brain, culminating in the formation of Aβ fibrils, leading to tau hyperphosphorylation, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and neurodegeneration.5,6 However, current AD therapies targeting Aβ production and amyloid formation offer only transient symptomatic relief and fail to halt disease progression, resulting in a lack of effective drugs for AD.1,7 Therefore, it is imperative and urgent to identify causal protein biomarkers to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of AD and to expedite the development of effective therapeutic interventions for AD. In causal inference, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) serve as the gold standard for evaluating the causal effect of an exposure on the health outcome of interest. However, it might be neither feasible nor ethical to perform RCTs where protein levels are considered as the exposures. Mendelian randomization (MR) leverages the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring to mimic RCTs to establish causality in non-randomized studies.8,9,10 MR uses genetic variants, typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as instrumental variables (IVs) to assess the causal association between an exposure and a health outcome.11 Recently, many MR methods have been developed to investigate causal relationships using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics data that consist of effect estimates of SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome associations from two sets of samples, which are commonly referred to as two-sample MR designs.12,13,14,15 Since summary statistics are often publicly available and provide abundant information of associations between genetic variants and complex traits/diseases, two-sample MR methods have become increasingly popular.14,16,17,18 In particular, recent studies with large-scale proteomics data have unveiled numerous protein quantitative traits loci (pQTLs) associated with thousands of proteins,19,20 facilitating the application of two-sample MR methods, where pQTLs serve as IVs, and protein levels serve as exposures, to identify proteins as causal biomarkers for complex traits and diseases. To employ MR for identifying causal protein biomarkers, conventional MR methods require the pQTLs included in the analysis to be valid IVs for reliable causal inference. A pQTL is called a valid IV if the following three core IV assumptions hold9,21:(A1) Relevance: the pQTL is associated with the protein.(A2) Effective random assignment: the pQTL is not associated with any unmeasured confounder of the protein-outcome relationship.(A3) Exclusion restriction: the pQTL affects the outcome only through the protein in view. Among the three core IV assumptions, (A1)–(A3), only A1 can be tested empirically by selecting pQTLs significantly associated with the protein. However, (A2) and (A3) cannot be empirically verified in general and may be violated in practice, which may lead to a biased estimate of the causal effect. For example, violation of (A2) may occur due to the presence of population stratification,9,22 and violation of (A3) may occur in the presence of horizontal pleiotropy,9,23 which is a widespread biological phenomenon, where the pQTL IV affects the outcome through other biological pathways that do not involve the protein in view; for example, through alternative splicing or microRNA effects.24,25,26 Recently, several MR methods have been proposed to handle invalid IVs under certain assumptions, as summarized in Table 1. Some of these additional assumptions for the identification of the causal effect in the presence of invalid IVs are listed below.(1)The instrument strength independent of direct effect (InSIDE) assumption: the pQTL-protein effect is asymptotically independent of the horizontal pleiotropic effect when the number of pQTL IVs goes to infinity; for example, the random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method,27 MR-Egger,28 MR-RAPS (robust adjusted profile score),16 and the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test.29.(2)Majority rule condition: up to 50% of the candidate pQTL IVs are invalid; for example, the weighted median method30 and MR-PRESSO.(3)Plurality rule condition or the zero modal pleiotropy assumption15,31: a plurality of the candidate IVs are valid, which is weaker than the majority rule condition; for example, the mode-based estimation,31 MRMix32 and the contamination mixture method.33(4)Other distributional assumptions. For example, MRMix and the contamination mixture method impose normal mixture distribution assumption on the genetic associations and the ratio estimates, respectively.Table 1Comparison of MR methods and the underlying assumptions for handling invalid IVsMR methodInSIDE assumptionMajority/plurality rule conditionOther distributional assumptionsRandom-effects IVWrequirednot requiredbalanced pleiotropy,NOME assumptionMR-Eggerrequirednot requiredNOME assumptionMR-RAPSrequirednot requiredbalanced pleiotropyMR-PRESSOrequiredmajority rule conditionnot requiredWeighed mediannot requiredmajority rule conditionnot requiredMode-based estimationnot requiredplurality rule conditionnot requiredMRMixnot requiredplurality rule conditiondirect effects of a SNP on the exposure and outcome follow a mixture of normal distributionsContamination mixture methodnot requiredplurality rule conditionratio estimate of a SNP follows a mixture of normal distributions,NOME assumptionMR-SPInot requiredplurality rule conditionnot requiredBalanced pleiotropy means that, on average, the pleiotropic effects have zero mean. NOME assumption means no measurement error in the exposure data. Despite many existing efforts, current MR methods still face new challenges when dealing with pQTL IVs for analyzing proteomics data. First, it is worth noting that the number of pQTLs for each protein tends to be small. For example, in two proteomics studies, the median number of pQTLs per protein is 4.20,34 With such a limited number of IVs, MR methods based on the InSIDE assumption, which requires a large number of IVs or other distributional assumptions, might yield unreliable results in the presence of invalid IVs.15,28 Second, current MR methods require an ad hoc set of pre-determined genetic IVs, which is often obtained by selecting genetic variants with strong pQTL-protein associations in proteomics data.35 Since such a traditional way of selecting IVs only requires the proteomics data, the same set of selected IVs is used for assessing the causal relationships between the protein in view and different health outcomes. Obviously, this one-size-fits-all strategy for selecting IVs might not work well for different outcomes because the underlying genetic architecture may vary across outcomes. For example, the pattern of horizontal pleiotropy might vary across different outcomes. Therefore, it is desirable to develop an automatic and computationally efficient algorithm to select a set of valid genetic IVs for a specific protein-outcome pair to perform reliable causal inference, especially when the number of candidate pQTL IVs is small. In this paper, we develop a novel all-in-one pipeline for causal protein biomarker identification and 3D structural alteration prediction using large-scale genetics, proteomics, and phenotype/disease data, as illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, we propose a two-sample MR method and algorithm that can automatically select valid pQTL IVs and then performs robust post-selection inference (MR-SPI) for the causal effect of proteins on the health outcome of interest. The key idea of MR-SPI is based on the Anna Karenina principle, which states that all valid instruments are alike, while each invalid instrument is invalid in its own way—paralleling Leo Tolstoy’s dictum that “all happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”36 In other words, valid instruments will form a group and should provide similar ratio estimates of the causal effect, while the ratio estimates of invalid instruments are more likely to be different from each other. With the application of MR-SPI, we can not only identify the causal protein biomarkers associated with disease outcomes but can also obtain missense genetic variations (used as pQTL IVs) for those identified causal proteins. These missense pQTL IVs will induce changes of amino acids, leading to 3D structural changes of these proteins. A classic example of a missense mutation was found in sickle cell disease, where the mutation at SNP rs334, located on chromosome 11 (11p15.4), results in the change of codon 6 of the β-globin chain from [GAA] to [GTA].37,38,39 This substitution leads to the replacement of glutamic acid with valine at position 6 of the β chain of the hemoglobin protein, altering the structure and function of hemoglobin protein. Consequently, red blood cells assume a crescent or sickle-shaped morphology, impairing blood flow to various parts of the body.40,41 Moreover, to further offer novel biological insights into the interpretation of the causal effect at the molecular level, we incorporate AlphaFold342,43,44,45 into our pipeline to predict the 3D structural alteration resulting from the corresponding missense pQTL IVs for the causal proteins identified by MR-SPI. Our pipeline can elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of how missense genetic variations translate into 3D structural alterations at the protein level, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and potentially informing targeted therapeutic interventions.Figure 1Overview of the pipelineFirst, we apply MR-SPI for each protein to (1) select valid pQTL IVs under the plurality condition and (2) estimate the causal effect on the outcome of interest. Second, we perform the Bonferroni correction procedure for causal protein identification. Third, for each causal protein biomarker, we apply AlphaFold3 to predict the 3D structural alterations due to missense pQTL IVs selected by MR-SPI. Our pioneering pipeline, for the first time, integrates the identification of causal protein biomarkers for health outcomes and the subsequent analysis of their 3D structural alterations into a unified framework, leveraging increasingly publicly available GWAS summary statistics for health research. Within our framework, the proposed MR-SPI serves dual purposes: (1) identifying causal protein biomarkers and (2) selecting valid missense pQTL IVs for subsequent 3D structural analysis. Compared to existing two-sample MR methods, MR-SPI is the first MR method that utilizes both exposure and outcome data to automatically select a set of valid IVs, especially when the number of candidate IVs is small in proteomics data, which is a prominent challenge with no satisfactory solution to date. We note that, while MR-PRESSO also selects valid IVs for MR analysis, it requires both the stronger majority rule condition and the InSIDE assumption as well as a minimum number of four candidate IVs for implementation.29 In contrast, our proposed MR-SPI does not require the InSIDE assumption and only requires the plurality rule condition that is weaker than the majority rule condition and only requires a minimum number of three IVs for the proposed voting procedure. Therefore, MR-SPI is more suitable for analyzing proteomics data. Extensive simulations show that our MR-SPI method outperforms other competing MR methods under the plurality rule condition. We employ MR-SPI to perform omics MR (xMR) with 912 plasma proteins using the large-scale UK Biobank proteomics data in 54,306 UK Biobank participants20 and find 7 proteins significantly associated with the risk of AD. We further use AlphaFold342,43,44,45 to predict the 3D structural alterations of these 7 proteins due to missense genetic variations and then illustrate the structural alterations graphically using the PyMOL software (https://pymol.org), providing new biological insights into their functional roles in AD development, which may aid in identifying potential drug targets.",
        "conclusion": "In this study, we develop a novel integrated pipeline that combines our proposed MR-SPI method with AlphaFold3 to identify putative causal protein biomarkers for complex traits/diseases and to predict the 3D structural alterations induced by missense pQTL IVs. Specifically, MR-SPI is an automatic algorithm to select valid pQTL IVs under the plurality rule condition for a specific protein-outcome pair from two-sample GWAS summary statistics. MR-SPI first selects relevant pQTL IVs with strong pQTL-protein associations to minimize weak IV bias and then applies the proposed voting procedure to select valid pQTL IVs whose ratio estimates are similar to each other. In the possible presence of locally invalid IVs in finite-sample settings, MR-SPI further provides a robust confidence interval constructed by the searching and sampling method,49 which is immune to finite-sample IV selection error. The valid pQTL IVs selected by MR-SPI serve dual purposes: (1) facilitating more reliable scientific discoveries in identifying putative causal proteins associated with diseases and (2) shedding new light on the molecular mechanism of causal proteins in disease etiology through the 3D structural alterations of mutated proteins induced by missense pQTL IVs. We employ MR-SPI to conduct xMR analysis with 912 plasma proteins using the proteomics data in 54,306 UKB participants and identify 7 proteins significantly associated with the risk of AD. The 3D structural changes in these proteins, as predicted by AlphaFold3 in response to missense genetic variations of selected pQTL IVs, offer new insights into their biological functions in the etiology of AD. We also found existing FDA-approved drugs that target some of our identified proteins, which provides opportunities for potential existing drug repurposing for the treatment of AD. These findings highlight the great potential of our proposed pipeline for identifying protein biomarkers as new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing for disease prevention and treatment. We emphasize three main advantages of MR-SPI. First, MR-SPI incorporates both proteomics and outcome data to automatically select a set of valid pQTL instruments in genome-wide studies, and the selection procedure does not rely on any additional distributional assumptions on the genetic effects nor require a large number of candidate IVs. Therefore, MR-SPI is the first method to offer such a practically robust approach to selecting valid pQTL IVs for a specific exposure-outcome pair from GWASs for more reliable MR analyses, which is especially advantageous in the presence of widespread horizontal pleiotropy and when only a small number of candidate IVs are available in xMR studies. While our real data application specifically focuses on the identification of putative causal protein biomarkers for AD through the integration of MR-SPI with AlphaFold3, it is important to highlight that MR-SPI holds broader applicability in elucidating causal relationships across complex traits and diseases. For additional data analysis results and insights into the utility of MR-SPI in this context, please refer to Figure S6. Second, we propose a robust confidence interval for the causal effect using the searching and sampling method, which is immune to finite-sample IV selection error. Therefore, when locally invalid IVs are selected incorrectly, MR-SPI can still provide reliable statistical inference for the causal effect using the proposed robust confidence interval. Third, MR-SPI is computationally efficient. The average computation time for constructing the standard CI, and the robust CI with 20 candidate IVs is 0.02 s and 10.60 s, respectively, using a server equipped with an Intel Xeon Silver 4116 CPU and 64 GB RAM memory. In conclusion, MR-SPI is a powerful tool for identifying putative causal protein biomarkers for complex traits and diseases. The integration of MR-SPI with AlphaFold3 as a computationally efficient pipeline can further predict the 3D structural alterations caused by missense pQTL IVs, improving our understanding of molecular disease mechanisms. Therefore, our pipeline holds promising implications for drug target discovery, drug repurposing, and therapy development."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia with few effective therapies. We aimed to identify potential plasma biomarkers or drug targets for AD by investigating the causal association between plasma proteins and AD by integrating comprehensive Mendelian randomization (MR) and multi-omics data. METHODS: Using two-sample MR, cis protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTLs) for 1,916 plasma proteins were used as an exposure to infer their causal effect on AD liability in individuals of European ancestry, with two large-scale AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets as the outcome for discovery and replication. Significant causal relationships were validated by sensitivity analyses, reverse MR analysis, and Bayesian colocalization analysis. Additionally, we investigated the causal associations at the transcriptional level with cis gene expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) data across brain tissues and blood in European ancestry populations, as well as causal plasma proteins in African ancestry populations. RESULTS: In those of European ancestry, the genetically predicted levels of five plasma proteins (BLNK, CD2AP, GRN, PILRA, and PILRB) were causally associated with AD. Among these five proteins, GRN was protective against AD, while the rest were risk factors. Consistent causal effects were found in the brain for cis-eQTLs of GRN, BLNK, and CD2AP, while the same was true for PILRA in the blood. None of the plasma proteins were significantly associated with AD in persons of African ancestry.

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by abnormal accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles in the brain . Recent progress in AD therapies mainly includes disease-modifying biologic therapy focused on reducing amyloid plaque to slow cognitive decline and advances in neuropsychiatric symptom treatment by ameliorating agitation . The core biomarkers of AD neuropathologic change mainly include imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma levels of Aβ, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and tau . Some plasma p-tau 217 assays have exhibited equivalent accuracy to approved diagnostic CSF assays . Compared to imaging and CSF biomarkers, blood-based biomarkers are less invasive and more cost-effective; they have the potential to act as screening tests, diagnostic tests, prognostic assessments, or monitoring tests . Identifying blood-based biomarkers involved in the AD biological process is essential for comprehensively understanding disease progression and developing a precision therapeutic strategy. AD is a complex and multifactorial condition influenced by many risk factors, including genetic, behavioral, environmental, lifestyle, and medical factors, among which genetic risk factors play a crucial role due to the high heritability of AD . With increasing large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs), more risk loci have been reported to be associated with AD. These studies help to decipher the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of AD and identify potential biomarkers and drug targets . However, most single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by GWASs are located in non-coding genomic regions, and their function is largely unknown. With advanced large-scale and high-throughput proteomics techniques, proteomics data from diverse populations are increasingly integrated with systems genetics to identify protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) — genetic variants associated with altered protein abundance . By integrating multi-omics data (GWAS data and pQTL data) and Mendelian randomization (MR), we have the tools to explore the causal relationships between protein abundance and disease phenotype . Mimicking the random assignment of treatment in randomized controlled trials, MR uses Mendel’s second law of independent segregation of genetic alleles to infer the potential reliable causal relationship between a risk factor (exposure) and disease risk (outcome) . To date, the integration of proteome-wide and transcriptome-wide MR studies has reported potential biomarkers or drug targets for AD, chronic kidney disease, depression, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke . With expanded coverage of antibody-based Olink assays, large proteomic datasets became available from different ancestries, where approximately twentyfold more plasma pQTLs were identified than found through previous antibody-based studies . The large-scale plasma pQTL data are invaluable to identifying candidate plasma biomarkers or therapeutic targets for many complex disorders like AD. Previous studies have leveraged longitudinal proteomics data from the UK Biobank to develop predictive models for incident AD and all-cause dementia, with the same plasma pQTL data providing genetic support for those proteins as early biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets . Although these studies have provided valuable insights into AD, leveraging updated datasets and refined analytical approaches is crucial to uncover novel plasma proteins, especially explore ancestry-specific associations, and better understand the protein-AD relationships at the transcriptional level. In this study, we aimed to identify plasma proteins that are causally associated with AD, with the intent of identifying potential plasma biomarkers or drug targets for AD. Leveraging the largest European ancestry plasma pQTL dataset and AD GWAS summary statistics, we conducted primary MR analysis followed by robust sensitivity analyses for discovery data. We then did replication, Bayesian colocalization analysis and phenotype scanning to validate our results from the discovery data. Additional replication at the transcriptional level was also used for validation. Finally, MR analysis was conducted between plasma pQTL and AD in data derived from individuals of African ancestry.",
        "conclusion": "In this study, our comprehensive pipeline included a series of stringent approaches with primary MR analysis, sensitivity analyses, reverse MR analysis, replicative validation, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and phenotype scanning. Our study identified five putative plasma proteins—BLNK, CD2AP, GRN, PILRA, and PILRB—that were causally associated with AD predisposition in European-ancestry populations, highlighting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic drug targets. We are the first to identify a causal relationship between the three proteins—BLNK, CD2AP, and PILRB—and AD predisposition. The two proteins GRN and PILRA were identified as being associated with AD in earlier MR studies . The increased genetically predicted levels of plasma proteins BLNK, CD2AP, PILRA, and PILRB were associated with higher AD risk, while the increased level of GRN was associated with lower AD risk. Of the five proteins, BLNK and GRN were associated with AD in both plasma proteome-wide and brain transcriptome-wide MR analyses. On the other hand, PILRB is associated with AD risk only in plasma proteome-wide MR analyses. PILRA exhibited a consistent causal effect on AD in plasma proteome-wide and blood transcriptome-wide MR analyses, while its transcriptional MR association was not supported by colocalization analysis. CD2AP showed significant causal associations in both plasma proteome-wide MR from the discovery stage and brain transcriptome-wide MR analyses, while its plasma proteome-wide MR result from the replication stage lacked colocalization evidence. In the African ancestry group, no causal associations were found between plasma proteins and AD. In this study, we prioritized five plasma proteins as potential diagnostic biomarkers or drug targets for AD in European ancestry populations, categorizing them into two tiers based on their relevance and potential impact. Examining the MR results of five putative proteins evaluated at both the transcriptional and protein levels, we found that they did not show significant causal associations with AD in blood cis-eQTLs as observed in plasma cis-pQTLs. The discordance between protein levels and their corresponding mRNA levels, as frequently observed in large cohorts, may stem from additional regulatory processes beyond transcription that influence protein expression, including variations in translation rates, modulation of protein stability and half-life, synthesis delays, and transport mechanisms . Moreover, protein levels in the plasma may be affected by brain-derived factors due to blood-brain barrier dysfunction or specific transport mechanisms, such as the bidirectional crossing of the blood-brain barrier by tau proteins . While the five putative proteins did not show significant associations in blood transcriptome-wide MR, they remain promising candidates for further investigation into their potential roles in AD. Two of the five identified proteins, CD2AP and GRN, were found to be associated with other traits via phenotype scanning, however, these associations could not fully explain their relationships with AD. For example, CD2AP-related SNP (rs13212790) was associated with standing height traits, which is not likely bias the CD2AP-AD relationship . C1QTNF1 was found to be trans-associated with GRN-related SNP (rs5848) , and showed no significant causal relationship with AD in our discovery stage, suggesting that it is less likely to bias the GRN-AD association. CD2AP (rs13212790) and GRN (rs5848) were both linked to blood cell traits, with rs5848 primarily associated with platelet traits and rs13212790 also associated with red cell and reticulocyte traits . However, previous MR studies have showed no causal relationship between those blood cell traits and AD predisposition , indicating that blood cell traits are unlikely to bias the observed associations between identified proteins and AD. Granulin, the precursor of progranulin, was previously reported to be casually associated with platelet count in an MR study, a finding further validated by gene knockdown experiments in cells . Progranulin regulates lysosomal function, playing a key role in inflammation and immunomodulation in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) . The evidence suggests that GRN might serve as a biological link between AD and CVD. It was also found that rs5848 was associated with cognitive scores for memory, which is the commonly used to assess AD progression . Phenotype scanning also revealed the association between rs5848 and long sleep duration . Previous study reported that AD risk was higher in the long sleep duration group without MR causal relationship, while another MR study showed that AD risk was negatively associated with long sleep duration . Due to inconsistent findings, the role of long sleep duration in the GRN-AD association remains uncertain and warrants further investigation. Our study shows that higher genetically predicted levels of the BLNK protein in plasma and higher expression of the BLNK gene in the cortex are correlated to an increased risk of AD. BLNK is an adaptor protein of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway and has been identified as an independent risk factor for colorectal cancer recurrence as well as a positive regulator of Met signaling in non-small cell lung cancer . It has been observed that the tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a role in the upregulation of BLNK with the activation of immune cells . Notably, the microglia receptor TREM2 is a direct p53 target gene, suggesting that BLNK is involved in the signaling pathway initiated by TREM2 . Studies have shown that the BLNK gene is predominantly expressed in microglia, and its upregulation in response to Aβ exposure suggests a role in microglial responses to Aβ pathology . Monitoring or targeting BLNK has the potential to understand the pathological progression of AD, but further studies are required. We found that higher levels of the CD2AP protein in plasma and higher expression of the CD2AP gene in the cortex increase the risk for AD. CD2AP is a multifunctional adaptor protein crucial for maintaining neuronal homeostasis, synaptic function, neurite structure, blood-brain barrier integrity, and calcium physiology . Genetic variants in the CD2AP locus are associated with increased CSF tau levels in mild cognitive impairment, decreased cognitive function in middle-aged individuals with a family history of AD, and increased risk of AD, all-cause dementia, and vascular dementia . Previous study reported that CD2AP enhances the degradation of amyloid precursor protein by accelerating its transition from early to late endosomes in neurons in vitro . However, another study reported that CD2AP loss of function did not exacerbate Aβ deposition or accumulation in an AD mouse model . Xue et al. found that neuronal CD2AP deficiency exacerbated tau phosphorylation, synaptic injury, and cognitive impairment in an AD mouse model . In contrast, CD2AP neuronal expression was positively associated with Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage in AD patients . These discrepant findings highlight the complex role of neuronal CD2AP expression in Aβ metabolism and tau pathology, suggesting CD2AP as a promising therapeutic target for AD. Further longitudinal studies of CD2AP levels in plasma are required to evaluate its potential as a biomarker for AD. Progranulin (encoded by the GRN gene), a glycoprotein mainly secreted by activated microglial cells in the brain, binds to Sortilin (encoded by the SORT1 gene) expressed on neuronal cell surfaces, leading to rapid endocytosis and delivery to the lysosome for degradation . Mutations in the GRN gene are commonly linked to familial frontotemporal dementia . Progranulin has been negatively associated with the risk of Parkinson’s disease . In prior MR studies, higher progranulin levels in both CSF and blood were associated with a protective effect in AD . Progranulin is the sole protective protein against AD we identified through MR, consistent with previous studies. In our study, the rs5848 T allele is associated with a 22% reduction of progranulin in plasma and is linked to a 23% increased risk of AD through MR analysis using the Wald ratio method. Higher GRN expression in the brain was associated with a lower risk of AD in our transcriptome-wide MR analyses. Additionally, rs5848 has been reported to be associated with hippocampal sclerosis and TDP-43 deposits . Progranulin is considered a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD . Currently, an anti-sortilin monoclonal antibody (GSK4527226), increasing progranulin levels in plasma and brain via inhibiting its binding with Sortilin, is entering a Phase 2 clinical trial to assess safety and efficacy in patients with early AD . PILRA is an inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of immune cells including microglia . Several studies have shown that a common missense variant of PILRA (G78R, rs1859788) is protective against AD by reducing its binding to several ligands in microglia. Because of this, PILRA might decrease microglial infection by the herpes simplex virus 1, a virus linked to AD risk . Debette et al. reported that the higher genetically determined levels of two soluble isoforms of PILRA (deltaTM and M14) in CSF and plasma are associated with a lower risk of AD . Plasma PILRA was found to be negatively associated with AD in another MR study with the same proteome data as in Debette et al.’s study . Cis-regulated levels of PILRA in CSF were negatively associated with AD in a study by Cruchaga et al. . In contrast, our study showed that a higher genetically predicted level of PILRA in plasma is associated with a higher risk of AD, consistent with previous studies. It is not clear why different effects of PILRA on AD have been reported. We note that the proteomic levels of the three studies with negative associations were measured by aptamer-based SomaScan assay, while the proteomic levels of our study were measured by the antibody-based Olink assay. Pietzner et al. reported a discordant association direction between the missense variant rs1859788 and PILRA levels measured by Olink and SomaScan assays . The discrepancy in the results is likely due to differences between the platforms used for protein measurement, as the two assays likely capture distinct aspects of protein chemistry. A recent study found that the Olink platform had higher protein target specificity and robust phenotypic associations and that the SomaScan platform exhibited greater measurement precision and breadth . Another study suggested that each protein might have different effects across different tissues . Hence, multi-platform proteomics across CSF and plasma is a promising strategy for further clarification of PILRA function in AD. Park et al. found that the PILRA gene is significantly upregulated in blood transcriptome data from patients with AD compared to normal controls . In addition, Smith et al. reported that the PILRA gene is upregulated in microglia isolated from neuropathologically defined AD brains and is correlated with Aβ and p-tau expression . According to Monroe et al., a high-affinity PILRA antagonist antibody phenocopying PILRA loss-of-function has been identified as a therapeutic approach for AD . Despite the conflicting causal effects reported in different studies, we still consider PILRA as a promising druggable target for AD. PILRB is expressed in inflammatory macrophages, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and microglial cells, all of which contribute to the production of inflammatory factors during infection . Our MR studies are the first to report that increased PILRB abundance is associated with a higher risk of AD. Since PILRB and PILRA belong to the same family, further research is needed to elucidate their respective roles in AD pathology. Our findings are corroborated by existing literature, demonstrating that MR serves as a promising proxy approach for prioritizing potential diagnostic biomarkers and drug targets for subsequent validation. The five putative proteins are mainly related to microglial activities and lysosomal functions, supporting a pivotal role of microglia and lysosomes in AD. Notably, higher plasma APP levels were associated with a lower risk for AD risk in our discovery stage. Although the association showed a similar trend in the replication stage, it did not reach statistical significance. The result seems paradoxical given that over dosage of APP gene in Down syndrome is linked to early-onset AD . This discrepancy emphasizes the need for further studies on tissue-specific expression, isoform-specific effects and post-translational modification patterns of APP to better understand its complex role in AD. Other studies have reported that PRSS8 was associated with an increased risk of AD in CSF but a reduced risk in plasma . Su et al. prioritized druggable gene EPHX2 as a potential therapeutic target for AD through transcriptome-wide and phenome-wide MR analyses . However, PRSS8 and EPHX2 were excluded in the replication stage as they failed to meet statistical significance after multiple testing correction. Further studies on these proteins are needed to clarify their true association with AD. Our study has several strengths. First, genetic instruments identified in a large-scale proteogenomic study were robust and powerful allowing us to explore the causal effect of plasma protein abundance on AD liability. By mimicking biomarker fluctuations and drug-target interactions observed in clinical trials, our comprehensive MR analyses provided an efficient and cost-effective approach to evaluate causality for the development of diagnosis biomarkers and drug targets for AD. Second, we systematically investigated and validated causal relationships between plasma protein and AD risk through two-sample MR analyses, leveraging large-scale cis-pQTL data and two independent AD GWAS datasets. A series of rigorous sensitivity analyses, reverse MR analysis, and Bayesian colocalization analysis were conducted to ensure the robustness and reliability of identified causal associations. Third, the consistent results observed in both proteomics and transcriptional levels across blood and brain tissues further strengthen the robustness of the findings. Last, we explored the causal effect between plasma pQTLs and AD in African ancestry. The putative causal associations identified in European ancestry were not replicated in African ancestry, highlighting potential differences in AD pathology in different ethnic groups. This study also has limitations. First, different protein measurement platforms may capture distinct isoforms, potentially leading to opposite causal directions as seen with PILRA in our MR analysis. Notably, evaluating causal associations between plasma protein levels and AD risk through genetically predicted changes from large populations may introduce inherent bias. Thus, validation of these findings requires measurements of plasma protein changes from individual-level data across multiple analytical platforms. Second, several MR associations were identified only when using the Wald ratio method due to a limited number of valid SNP IVs after harmonization, which did not allow further sensitivity analyses. Although colocalization analysis and phenotype scanning were conducted, not all potential horizontal pleiotropy or confounding factors could be eliminated. Third, not all of the pQTLs are available in African ancestry data, thus, it is impossible to fully compare our results across different ethnic groups. In addition, the sample size for African ancestry is much smaller compared to that for European ancestry, which may reduce the power of the analysis. Further validation of our findings would require functional assessment of these biomarkers or targets in either induced pluripotent stem cells or animal models of AD. Ultimately, therapeutic validation would entail implementing these observations in clinical trials. Blood-based biomarkers have the potential to enhance patient recruitment and stratification for clinical trials and advance the development of diagnostics and precision medicine. Recently, Jiang et al. reported a blood-based 21-protein assay that captures changes in multiple biological pathways, accurately classifying AD and mild cognitive impairment across different ethnic populations . Plasma biomarkers prioritized through MR, followed by further validation and mechanistic studies, have enormous potential for improving the diagnosis and advancing therapeutic development for AD. By using the expression levels of drug targets as proxies for drug exposure and employing genetic variants associated with the expression level of drug targets as IVs for MR analysis, the potential effects of drug target inhibitors on the risk of other diseases can be inferred . A large sample of proteomic data from diverse ethnic groups, measured across different platforms, is essential for identifying potential protein biomarkers or drug targets for AD. In conclusion, five plasma proteins demonstrated causal effects for AD in European ancestry populations. Among these, BLNK and GRN were prioritized as Tier 1 causal proteins for AD, while CD2AP, PILRA, and PILRB were nominated as Tier 2 causal proteins for AD. Further studies with these five plasma proteins could provide more insights into AD pathology, potentially serving as blood-based biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapeutic targets for the treatment."

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. These developments have enabled the broader application of iPSCs in neuroscience, improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and advanced the investigation of therapeutic targets and methods. Specifically, optimizations in reprogramming protocols, coupled with improved neuronal differentiation and maturation techniques, have greatly facilitated the generation of iPSC-derived neural cells. The integration of the cerebral organoid technology and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has further propelled the application of iPSCs in neurodegenerative diseases to a new stage. Patient-derived or CRISPR-edited cerebral neurons and organoids now serve as ideal disease models, contributing to our understanding of disease pathophysiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets and candidates. In this review, we examine the development of iPSC-based models in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.",

        "introduction": "Since the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in 2006, two decades of advancements have enabled the widespread application of iPSCs, their differentiated cells and organoids in modeling neurological diseases, elucidating pathogenic mechanisms, and advancing cell-based therapies . Previous reviews have extensively discussed the advantages of iPSC-derived patient-specific in vitro cellular models over traditional animal models and human embryonic stem cells, particularly in disease-specific applications . However, significant limitations persist in recapitulating disease-specific pathological phenotypes and mechanistic pathways using iPSC-derived cells and organoids . For instance, heterogeneity and dosage variability remain critical challenges due to differences in cellular/tissue sources, induction protocols, and culture conditions . Furthermore, the existing induction protocols still face technical complexities and cannot indefinitely generate all desired human cell types . To address these challenges, researchers have continuously improved iPSC generation methods and differentiation protocols. Simultaneously, the expanding application of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology has enabled precise genetic modifications in iPSCs, their differentiated cells, and even organoids, while preserving patient-specific genetic backgrounds . These advances have elevated research on disease-specific model establishment, mechanistic investigation, and high-throughput drug screening to new heights. This review systematically elaborates on the recent progress in iPSC induction and iPSC differentiation into neurons, glial cells, and organoids, while examining the applications of these cellular and organoid systems as in vitro disease models for neurodegenerative disorders.",
        "conclusion": "Looking forward, the continuous advancement of the iPSC technology has opened new avenues for research into neurodegenerative diseases. Studies utilizing iPSC-derived neurons, neural stem cells, glial cells, and brain organoids have provided valuable insights, particularly for disease phenotypes that manifest only in mature neurons after progressing through intermediate neural progenitor stages. Despite these advancements, the establishment of in vitro models using iPSCs remains economically challenging. This is largely attributed to the low density and limited reprogramming efficiency of fibroblasts and PBMCs, which are commonly used as source materials for iPSC generation. These limitations pose significant barriers to the large-scale application of iPSC-derived cells and organoids in drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases. To overcome these challenges, researchers have increasingly explored direct reprogramming approaches as a promising alternative. In summary, iPSC-based in vitro models, such as neurons and organoids, enable researchers to recapitulate neurodegenerative diseases in diverse and physiologically relevant forms, deepening our understanding of disease mechanisms. These models hold immense promise for advancing the development of targeted therapies and novel drugs, offering renewed hope for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia in the elderly and its increasing prevalence presents treatment challenges. Despite a better understanding of the disease, the current mainstay of treatment cannot modify pathogenesis or effectively address the associated cognitive and memory deficits. Emerging evidence suggests adenosine G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are promising therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease. The adenosine A1 and A2A receptors are expressed in the human brain and have a proposed involvement in the pathogenesis of dementia. Targeting these receptors preclinically can mitigate pathogenic β-amyloid and tau neurotoxicity whilst improving cognition and memory. In this review, we provide an accessible summary of the literature on Alzheimer's disease and the therapeutic potential of A1 and A2A receptors. Although there are no available medicines targeting these receptors approved for treating dementia, we provide insights into some novel strategies, including allosterism and the targeting of oligomers, which may increase drug discovery success and enhance the therapeutic response.",

        "introduction": "Dementias are the most prevalent neurological disorder in the aged population, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide in 2020 . In the absence of effective therapies, the number of people with dementia is projected to double every 20 years, reaching 152 million in 2050 . While there are hundreds of described neurodegenerative dementias, the most common is AD . Sporadic AD, the most common form, seems to be multifactorial, with age, genetic, and environmental factors contributing to disease risk, manifestation, and progression . AD is classically defined as a dual clinicopathological entity, meaning that to fully diagnose AD requires (i) observations of a specified clinical presentation over time, related to episodic memory impairment and other cognitive, behavioural, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities and (ii) observations of specific neurological changes (e.g. neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, synaptic loss). Recent advances in amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have enabled the detection of in vivo biological evidence of AD pathologies to assist the classification of presymptomatic AD stages .",
        "conclusion": "Dementia remains a significant neurological disorder. This review has highlighted preclinical studies implicating A1R and A2AR as promising GPCR targets for Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, A1R and A2AR inhibition seems to mitigate the neurotoxicity associated with the β-amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation and improve cognition and memory. Stimulation of A1R can also promote neuroprotection and therefore adds an additional layer of complexity in considering agonism versus antagonism when targeting this receptor. Although not explored for AD, the notion of biased agonism, which is a growing paradigm at adenosine receptors , could conceptually be harnessed to develop an A1R compound to improve cognition but also remain neuroprotective. Indeed, although drug discovery at adenosine receptors has traditionally experienced hurdles, the novel therapeutic paradigms covered in this review, including allostery and the targeting of oligomers, present a promising future avenue of investigation. It is hoped harnessing this knowledge may increase the development and translation of clinical candidates with enhanced therapeutic responses and limited side effects."

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a global health crisis. Treatments are needed to prevent, delay the onset, slow the progression, improve cognition, and reduce behavioral disturbances of AD. We review the current clinical trials and drugs in development for the treatment of AD. METHODS: We searched the governmental website clinicaltrials.gov where are all clinical trials conducted in the United States must be registered. We used artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches to ensure comprehensive detection and characterization of trials and drugs in development. We use the Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) to classify drug targets and mechanisms of action of drugs in the pipeline. RESULTS: As of January 25, 2022 (index date for this study) there were 143 agents in 172 clinical trials for AD. The pipeline included 31 agents in 47 trials in Phase 3, 82 agents in 94 trials in Phase 2, and 30 agents in 31 trials in Phase 1. Disease-modifying therapies represent 83.2% of the total number of agents in trials; symptomatic cognitive enhancing treatments represent 9.8% of agents in trials; and drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms comprise 6.9%. There is a diverse array of drug targets represented by agents in trials including nearly all CADRO categories. Thirty-seven percent of the candidate agents in the pipeline are repurposed drugs approved for other indications. A total of 50,575 participants are needed to fulfill recruitment requirements for all currently active clinical trials. DISCUSSION: The AD drug development pipeline has agents representing a substantial array of treatment mechanisms and targets. Advances in drug design, outcome measures, use of biomarkers, and trial conduct promise to accelerate the delivery of new and better treatments for patients with AD. HIGHLIGHTS: There are 143 drugs in the current Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development pipeline.Disease-modifying therapies represent 83.2% of the candidate treatments.Current trials require 50,575 participants who will donate 3,878,843 participant-weeks to clinical trials.The biopharmaceutical industry sponsors 50% of all clinical trials including 68% of Phase 3 trials.Sixty-three percent of Phase 3 trials and 46% of Phase 2 trials include non-North American clinical trial site locations indicating the global ecosystem required for AD drug development.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing as the size of the aged population grows. 1 In the United States there are currently 6.2 million individuals with AD dementia and the number will reach 12.7 million by 2050. In addition to those with AD in the dementia stages, there are ≈10 million individuals in the United States with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), half of whom (5 million) have MCI due to AD. The total number of persons in the United States with symptomatic forms of AD—MCI due to AD and AD dementia—is 11.2 million. 1 The estimated 2021 cost of caring for those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) was $355 billion. The world‐wide prevalence of AD dementia will triple from its current 50 to 150 million by 2050 with most of those affected living in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 2 The need for therapy to prevent, delay the onset, slow the progression, and improve the symptoms of AD is compelled by the rising number of those with AD and the growing public health crisis posed by the disease. Advances in therapy are being achieved; aducanumab, the first disease‐modifying therapy (DMT) to be approved for AD, became available on the market for those with MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia in 2021. Aducanumab is an anti‐amyloid monoclonal antibody, and two more monoclonal antibodies (donanemab and lecanemab) are under review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 3 , 4 , 5 Additional new treatments for AD may become available in the foreseeable future. We review the drugs in current clinical trials for AD. We present data from analyses of the clinicaltrials.gov registry, noting agents in Phase 1, 2, and 3; we describe their mechanism of action (MoA) and major trial characteristics. Our goal is to provide an update on agents being developed for AD and to present information on progress in the field of AD therapeutic development. The report follows the strategy developed in previous annual reviews of the AD pipeline. 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 The current report used more advanced analytic tools than previously applied including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate our interrogation of clinicaltrials.gov.",
        "conclusion": "Development of new therapies for diseases of the nervous system is challenging with high failure rates and long development times forcing some major pharmaceutical companies to stop investing in this area of drug development. 18 Of the 49 novel drugs approved by the FDA in 2021, seven were for treatment of disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) and two were for the peripheral nervous system disorders (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis; fda.gov). 19 The CNS disorders with new treatments were migraine, von Hippel‐Lindau disease (including CNS hemangioblastomas), schizophrenia, relapsing multiple sclerosis, attention deficit‐hyperactivity disorders (two drugs approved), and AD. The AD drug approval is the first in the United States since 2003. The AD drug development pipeline comprises 143 agents in 172 trials (Figure 1). There are 31 agents in Phase 3, 82 in Phase 2, and 31 in Phase 1. DMTs are the agents most included in the pipeline. One hundred nineteen putative DMTs are being assessed (21 in Phase 3, 71 in Phase 2, 27 in Phase 1). DMTs represent 83.2% of the pipeline of agents. There are 14 cognitive enhancers and 10 drugs targeting neuropsychiatric symptoms in the pipeline. The 143 agents in the pipeline compares to 126 in the pipeline in 2021; 10 , 11 this apparent increase may be partially attributable to our improved search techniques. Aducanumab is the first DMT approved by the US FDA for the treatment of AD. It is the second DMT approved in the United States for any neurodegenerative disease, the other is edaravone used in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 20 The approval of aducanumab used an accelerated regulatory mechanism based on demonstration of amyloid plaque lowering considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. 21 The accelerated pathway may be used for other anti‐amyloid plaque‐lowering antibodies currently under review by the FDA (donanemab and lecanemab). 3 , 4 , 5 The trials of gantenerumab will be completed in 2022 and may lead to a request for marketing approval based on conventional clinical outcomes. 22 , 23 Other biomarkers may eventually be qualified as surrogate outcomes predictive of clinical benefit. Surrogate outcomes facilitate drug development. 24 MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia comprise the most common population included in current clinical trials accounting for 36% of Phase 3 trials and 52% of Phase 2 trials. 25 These trials may be most impacted by the approval of aducanumab for this same population. Trial patients eligible for aducanumab may wish to begin active therapy rather than remain in a placebo‐controlled trial that will last many months; patients appropriate for treatment with aducanumab and eligible for trial participation may prefer active treatment to trial enrollment; or patients on aducanumab may wish to continue this treatment and be included in trials of potential new AD therapies in addition to their ongoing treatment. Trial design will require reconsideration to account for the presence of aducanumab in the market. 26 Among the trial design options are to exclude patients on aducanumab from participation in a trial assessing a new therapy as is currently done in some AD trials that exclude cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. Another option is to allow aducanumab as background therapy with stratification, analytic adjustment, and recalculation of sample sizes required to show a treatment effect. Trials comparing a novel agent to aducanumab may be conducted with superiority or a non‐inferiority design with clinical efficacy, biomarker effects, or safety as primary or key secondary outcomes. AD therapeutic research can build on lessons learned from multiple sclerosis where multiple DMTs have been approved using a variety of assessment strategies. 27 The CADRO classification of targets reveals a proliferation of mechanistic treatment approaches to AD including agents directed at amyloid (20 agents), tau (13 agents), inflammation (23 agents), and synaptic plasticity (19 agents). Altogether 15 of the 17 categories (excluding “unknown” and “other”) are represented by drugs in the pipeline (Figure 4). Seven monoclonal antibodies, one active vaccine, one ASO, and four small molecules directed at aspects of the biology of the tau protein and neurofibrillary tangle formation are currently in AD clinical trials. The antibodies are directed primarily at extracellular tau that is transferred from cell to cell in a prion‐like manner. Several tau monoclonal antibodies have failed to establish a drug–placebo difference in recent AD trials including semorinemab, zagotenemab, gosuranemab, and ABBV‐8E12. 28 , 29 Targets for monoclonal antibodies in the current AD pipeline other than the canonical amyloid and tau proteins include antibodies directed at TREM2, CD38, semaphorin 4D, and galactin 3. The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus and ensuing pandemic have challenged trial sites and temporarily slowed drug development. Many COVID‐related issues affected trial sites including temporary or permanent site closure; delayed recruitment; participant reluctance to visit sites for clinical assessments and laboratory tests; patient and care partner decisions to stop trial participation; difficulty providing drugs to participants not visiting sites; the change of on‐site testing stemming from masks, shields, and COVID testing procedures; the need to develop unanticipated strategies for remote data collection and laboratory testing; the requirement to adjust procedures to obtain or renew informed consent remotely; illness and death of trial participants; and illness, death, and resignation of trial site staff. 30 The FDA provided guidance of Good Clinical Practice of trial conduct during the pandemic. 31 , 32 The FDA also provided guidance on statistical and analytic considerations for data from trials affected by the COVID pandemic. 31 Many AD trial outcomes were successfully administered using telemedicine without compromise of data reliability. 33 Statistical modeling and trial simulation of AD trials indicated that stopping trials usually resulted in substantial loss of power and prolonging or enlarging trials were strategies to preserve trial integrity. 34 Despite the many challenges posed by the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic, the AD trial ecosystem proved to be resilient with few trials stopped during the pandemic and a substantial number of new trials initiated. The increased use of composite outcomes is apparent in this review. This trend is especially evident in trials in early AD (MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia) in which a significant drug–placebo difference on a single primary outcome measure may be the basis for regulatory approval. Many trials in this stage of the disease use the Clinical Dementia Rating–Sum of Boxes (CDR‐SB) as the primary outcome. 35 Phase 2 trials have used a greater diversity of primary clinical outcomes. The Phase 2 trial of lecanemab used the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS)—an analytic approach using the all items of the CDR and elements of the MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive subscale (ADAS‐Cog)—as an outcome and as a guide to dose decisions in the Bayesian dose‐finding portion of the study. 5 , 36 The Phase 2 trial of donanemab used the integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) comprising the ADAS‐Cog‐13 and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADL) scale as the primary clinical outcome measure. Composite endpoints, when appropriately constructed and interpreted, provide greater measurement efficiency and can facilitate efficacy conclusions with smaller sample sizes. 37 Biomarkers play increasingly informative roles in AD trials. The Phase 2 trial of donenemab used tau PET to define the population, requiring the presence of tau but without a high level of tau abundance suggesting advanced disease. 4 Nearly all the participants meeting the tau PET criteria had positive amyloid imaging; the discordance was 0.9% of individuals who met the tau PET criteria and not the amyloid PET criteria. This supports the observation that the presence of moderate levels of tau are highly predictive of the amyloid plaque burden. 38 , 39 Plasma p‐tau is highly correlated with amyloid PET 40 , 41 and is being used to identify participants for some AD trials (e.g., Trailblazer 3). If confirmed, use of p‐tau to identify individuals for AD trials is anticipated to simplify and accelerate AD trial recruitment. Other notable observations from this pipeline review include the large number of participants needed for all ongoing trials (50,757) and the tremendous amount of participant time devoted to trials (3,878,843 weeks spent in trials). The long periods required for participant recruitment are documented in this review; many trials have recruitment periods that exceed the treatment period by 2‐fold. The key role played by the biopharmaceutical industry in drug development is highlighted by the observation that industry sponsors 68% of all Phase 3 trials and 41 percent of all Phase 2 trials. The NIH and academic medical centers play a large role in Phase 2 proof‐of‐concept studies (36% of trials) and a smaller role in late‐stage drug development (15% of Phase 3 trials). Repurposed agents have a greater role in proof‐of‐concept and are more likely to be funded by NIH (56%) than biopharmaceutical sponsors (21%). 42 Global participation in drug development is evident in this review. Sixty‐three percent of Phase 3 trials and 46% of Phase 2 trials include non‐North American sites. This review is based on data from the clinical trials registry, clinicaltrials.gov. Recent studies support the use of this data source. Venugopal and Saberwal showed that clinicaltrials.gov is more comprehensive than any other of the 18 worldwide registries they reviewed. 15 The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 requires reporting of trial results within 1 year of trial completion and the FDA and NIH are increasingly vigilant about enforcement of this mandate, further strengthening the data available from the registry. 43 The registry and our search strategies are imperfect, and some agents may have been omitted in this review."

        "title": "Neuronal ApoE4 in Alzheimer's disease and potential therapeutic targets.",
        "abstract": "The most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a gene located on chromosome 19 that encodes three alleles (e2, e3, and e4) that give rise to the ApoE subtypes E2, E3, and E4, respectively. E2 and E4 have been linked to increased plasma triglyceride concentrations and are known to play a critical role in lipoprotein metabolism. The prominent pathological features of AD mainly include senile plaques formed by amyloid β (Aβ42) aggregation and neuronal fibrous tangles (NFTs), and the deposited plaques are mainly composed of Aβ hyperphosphorylation and truncated head. In the central nervous system, the ApoE protein is primarily derived from astrocytes, but ApoE is also produced when neurons are stressed or affected by certain stress, injury, and aging conditions. ApoE4 in neurons induces Aβ and tau protein pathologies, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, impairing learning and memory functions. However, how neuronal ApoE4 mediates AD pathology remains unclear. Recent studies have shown that neuronal ApoE4 may lead to greater neurotoxicity, which increases the risk of AD development. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of neuronal ApoE4 and explains how neuronal ApoE4 mediates Aβ deposition, pathological mechanisms of tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and potential therapeutic targets.",

        "introduction": "AD is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by extensive brain atrophy and cognitive function deterioration. This progressive condition is speculated to initiate decades prior to symptom onset, frequently without apparent cause (Beason-Held et al., 2013). Epidemiological and genome-wide association studies have implicated ApoE4 as the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD (Corder et al., 1993; Shi et al., 2012). ApoE is a lipid transporter, a 299-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 34 kDa (Sullivan et al., 1998; Guo et al., 2020). It consists of three common subtypes, E2, E3, and E4 (Figure 1), which are similar at the main sequence level but differ in individual amino acid substitution. The negative effects of E4 arise from “domain interactions,” including: the amino-terminal domain containing the LDL receptor-binding region and the carboxyl-terminal domain containing the lipid-binding region, which are held together by a flexible hinge region to form a more compact structure. ApoE is secreted in cells and then lipidated by ATP-bound cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1, resulting in lipoprotein particles (Nikoulin and Curtiss, 1998; Bu, 2009; Huang, 2010; Yamazaki et al., 2019). Apolipoproteins play a key role in redistributing cholesterol and other lipids to neurons by binding to apolipoprotein receptors on the cell surface. The degree of lipidation of ApoE4 affects its ability to bind LDLR (Huang and Mucke, 2012; Martens et al., 2022). Apolipoproteins have also been found to play a key role in the transfer of lipids from intracellular to extracellular space (Mody and MacDonald, 1995). After neuronal degeneration, apolipoproteins are able to bind lipids and facilitate their redistribution for cell lipid diffusion, membrane repair, or remodeling of new axons. ApoE4 produced in damaged neurons is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and the formation of NFTs, while ApoE4 produced in astrocytes may be primarily responsible for the formation of Aβ. ApoE4 produced in or around blood vessels is also thought to be important for the formation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and these findings may be particularly important for reducing the risk of AD (Xu et al., 2006; Takeda et al., 2010; Huang and Mucke, 2012; Figure 2). AD is distinguished by two primary pathological hallmarks: extracellular Aβ plaques, which are aggregates of Aβ peptides, also known as senile plaques, and NFTs, which consist of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein within neurons (Koutsodendris et al., 2022). The involvement of chromosome 19 in late-onset AD was previously substantiated by the discovery of ApoE on chromosome 19 and the association of AD with this chromosome (Pericak-Vance et al., 1988, 1991; Strittmatter et al., 1993a). Genetic components have long been associated with AD due to the familial clustering of AD cases (El Haj et al., 2015). In recent years, numerous researches have been carried out on the structural properties, biochemical and pathophysiological effects of neuronal ApoE4. The aim is to reveal the magnitude of the toxic effect of neuronal ApoE4 compared to its traditionally roles of astrocytes and microglia-derived ApoE4. This includes the expression of ApoE4 in neurons, the mechanism of action, and potential treatment options. This review discusses neuronal-derived ApoE4 and possible therapeutic options for ApoE4 from this source to facilitate the development of AD disease research.",
        "conclusion": "Many studies on AD have shown that ApoE play an important role in the hereditary pathogenesis of AD. The latest research shows that when neurons are stimulated by aging, damage and other factors, it becomes the main source of ApoE4, and its neurotoxicity is much greater than that secreted by astrocytes. It has been found that neuronal ApoE4 mediates the pathophysiology of AD may include: prevents lipid excretion; induces inflammation of microglia to damage neurons; participation in the occurrence of Tau pathology, etc.; and studies have confirmed that selective removal of ApoE4 from neurons significantly reduce Tau pathology, glial proliferation, neurodegeneration, neuronal hyperexcitability, and myelin deficiency (Koutsodendris et al., 2023). However, the specific mechanism has not been fully explained. As well as another pathological feature of AD: Aβ plaques, it is still unknown whether neuronal ApoE4 mediates the formation of Aβ and the specific pathophysiological mechanism. Several potential treatment options for AD targeting ApoE4 also been collated and discussed. At present, drugs in terms of ApoE4 quantity and lipidation are mainly agonists of liver X receptor (LXR) and retinol X receptor (RXR)-Bexarotene is approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and can be reused for other indications. It has been used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and Kaposi sarcoma (Farol and Hymes, 2004). Bexarotene has been observed to be effective in alleviating pathological and cognitive deficits in animals with Animals with Aβ pathology, but the use of bexarotene in AD is controversial due to its significant toxicity, typically increasing triglyceride and cholesterol levels and increasing the risk of hypothyroidism (Graeppi-Dulac et al., 2014; Cummings et al., 2016). Another treatment that targets the regulation of ApoE4 lipidation, the small molecule miR-33, whose inhibition increases ABCA1 expression and activity in rodents and non-human primates, thereby increasing ApoE4 lipidation without serious metabolic adverse reactions (Jan et al., 2015). The deficiency of miR-33 also increases HDL-C and increases the outflow of cholesterol from macrophages through ABCA 1 and ABCG 1, which prevents the progression of atherosclerosis (Horie et al., 2012). The above conclusions have been supported by experimental data, but the disadvantage is that many genes are changed after knocking down miR-33 in mice, so detailed experiments are needed to establish miR-33-targeted therapies in humans. Active Aβ42 immunity in AD patients leads to Aβ removal, associated with a decrease in phosphorylated Tau, long-term downregulation of inflammation, a decrease in the number of neurons, and an abnormal decrease in neuritis (Nicoll et al., 2006; Paquet et al., 2018). Active immunity with Aβ carries a risk of adverse immune response, leading to inflammation such as meningoencephalitis, and lacks the ability to regulate the level and duration of the response (Paquet et al., 2018). Passive immunity induces antibody–antigen complexes that are fully ligated to the Fc γ receptor (Fc γ R) on microglia, which can cause adverse pro-inflammatory reactions that may lead to observed BBB disruption such as angiogenic edema and/or cerebral microhemorrhage. In contrast, passive immunity may provide a safer treatment option for AD immunotherapy (Orgogozo et al., 2003; Adolfsson et al., 2012). Another therapeutic drug ASO, which can be used as therapeutic agents by disrupting the synthesis of specific proteins, are considered as first-line treatments for several neurodegenerative conditions such as polyneuropathy, muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy (Hinrich et al., 2016; DeVos et al., 2017; Scoles et al., 2019). ASO therapy led to improved synaptic function in mice with Aβ pathology, and specifically targeting ApoE has been successful in reducing Aβ pathology in APP/PS1 mice when treated before Aβ deposition begins (Paquet et al., 2015). At present, the expression of microtubule-associated protein Tau by ASO-targeting has been subjected to phase Ib clinical trials (Mummery et al., 2023), and the results showed that the subjects are well tolerated by the drug, and the most common side effect is headache after injection, but no serious adverse events have been seen in the patients with the treatment. It is worth mentioning that ASO therapy QALSODY (tofersen) is currently available for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Mummery et al., 2023). Moreover, drugs targeting the structural properties of ApoE4, phase IIa clinical trials of structural correctors (VX-809) and phase III trials of synergists (VX-770) have been completed (Chen et al., 2012). Despite the failure of the anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody M266 in clinical trials, aducanumab was recently approved as the first Aβ monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of AD, bringing new hope to AD patients around the world. For promising treatment options, the efficacy of which can now be monitored with biomarkers, such as new imaging techniques (PET) and CSF, CSF and PET were used in a report on the prevalence of amyloid abnormalities, including APOE carrier status, dementia severity, etc., to estimate the prevalence of amyloid abnormalities (Jansen et al., 2022). Last year, a clinical research team combined plasma p-Tau, ApoE genotype and MRI brain atrophy measurements to accurately predict Aβ PET deposition (Gao et al., 2022). However, problems such as expensive and invasive injury have not been properly addressed in clinical practice (Mahaman et al., 2022). Other promising sources of biomarkers are saliva, tears, and urine (Blennow and Zetterberg, 2018; Mahaman et al., 2022; Teunissen et al., 2022). They have the advantage of being non-invasive, and a lot of research is being done from these. However, the specific therapeutic role still needs to be studied, which includes metabolisms and toxicology, as well as clearer and more accurate pharmacological data. In summary, many researches have been done on ApoE4 and AD in the past, but they are limited to a certain cell or pathway. People with the ApoE4 gene not only have a high risk of AD, but also have an early onset of AD. and ApoE4 is a risk factor for the onset of AD, rather than a direct causative factor; ApoE4 works in combination with other mechanisms to cause the onset of AD. Therefore, finding the etiology of synergy with ApoE4 and identifying the mechanism is the key to intervention in this risk factor. At present, the study of neuronal ApoE4 has only explored its aggravation of Tau pathology, but how neuronal ApoE4 mediates pathological changes in other cells remains to be proven, and a stable method is found to specifically knock out the ApoE4 gene in neurons to improve pathological symptoms. Future research needs more in-depth and comprehensive research and exploration. It is necessary to know the complete system of neuronal ApoE4 and AD pathophysiology and develop more effective treatment methods. Exploring the mechanism of neuronal ApoE4 and AD is challenging, but it provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of AD."

        "abstract": "With complex pathogenesis, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological illness that has worsened over time. Inter-organ crosstalk, which is essential for coordinating organ function and maintaining homeostasis, is involved in multiple physiological and pathological events. Increasing evidence suggests that AD is closely associated with multiple diseases of peripheral organs, including the gut, adipose tissue, liver, and bone. Despite numerous studies on AD, the ambiguous role of pathological peripheral organ-brain crosstalk in the development of AD remains incompletely understood, and the potential mechanisms remain obscure. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the relationship between AD and disorders of various organs from clinical and preclinical evidence. Additionally, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying AD development from the perspective of \"organ-organ crosstalk\", including the gut-brain, adipose tissue-brain, liver-brain and bone-brain axes. On the basis of the peripheral organ-brain crosstalk, we emphasize promising therapeutic targets with the hope of providing novel perspectives for AD management.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of dementia in elderly individuals. Currently, 50 million individuals are vulnerable to AD globally according to the estimation of Alzheimer's Disease International, and it is estimated that the incidence of AD will increase by 2 times by 2050 . The primary clinical features of AD include cognitive deterioration, difficulties in daily activities and neuropsychiatric symptoms . The pathological hallmarks of AD include the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, resulting from the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau proteins . Current therapeutic strategies, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, are largely ineffective and cannot prevent or cure the disease . The development of effective therapies demands a deep comprehension of the key factors driving the progression of AD. Currently, inter-organ crosstalk is pivotal for maintaining human homeostasis and disease pathogenesis . Most organs can communicate with local and distant organs through the secretion of lipids, proteins, metabolites and extracellular vesicles in an endocrine/paracrine/autocrine manner . Emerging evidence suggests that peripheral organ-brain crosstalk is central for brain health and neurological diseases, such as AD . Studies highlight that AD is strongly linked to other organ disorders, including gut dysbiosis, obesity, hepatic dysfunction, and orthopedic disease, as shown in Table 1 . The brain and peripheral organs, like the gut, adipose tissue, liver, and bone, can communicate in various ways through the gut-brain axis, adipose tissue-brain axis, liver-brain axis, and bone-brain axis, consequently influencing the onset and progression of AD . Thus, a deep understanding of the peripheral organ-brain crosstalk is critical for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD and the exploration of potential novel therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarize the peripheral organ disorders associated with AD and relevant clinical and preclinical evidence. We also highlight the contribution of peripheral organ-brain crosstalk to the pathological processes of AD and elucidate promising therapeutic targets.",
        "conclusion": "In recent decades, organ-organ crosstalk has allowed the exchange of messages and information, which is essential for maintaining homeostasis and coordinating organ functions. Increasing evidence indicates that AD is a multi-organ disease and that various peripheral organ dysfunctions can affect the occurrence and development of AD through inter-organ crosstalk, such as gut-brain crosstalk, adipose tissue-brain crosstalk, liver-brain crosstalk and bone-brain crosstalk. Despite decades of in-depth research, current treatments for AD are limited. Hence, exploring the mechanisms of peripheral organ disorders in the pathogenesis of AD from a multi-organ perspective will help develop more novel and effective therapies for AD. As highlighted in this review, we emphasize the current mechanisms of the inter-organ crosstalk between the brain and peripheral organs involved in the pathogenesis of AD, such as gut dysbiosis induced by intestinal disorders, which promotes AD development via the secretion of a variety of metabolites, functional byproducts and toxins; dysfunction of adipose tissue in obesity is involved in AD pathogenesis via changes in fatty acid and adipokine secretion profiles and metabolism; liver dysfunction mediates Aβ clearance reduction and toxin accumulation in the brain; and dysregulated bone tissue-derived proteins and immune cells, as well as calcium imbalance, accelerate AD development. However, the potential mechanisms involved in various peripheral organ disorders in AD pathogenesis have still not been fully clarified, and additional foundational studies are needed to explore the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, developing more promising inter-organ crosstalk-based therapeutic interventions for AD will provide more personalized and effective therapeutic options. In conclusion, the crosstalk between the brain and peripheral organs may play an indelible role in AD development. A better understanding of the pathogenic “crosstalk” between the brain and extracerebral organs will help identify risk factors related to AD onset and progression, as well as explore novel therapeutic targets. In addition, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of interactive networks in the pathogenesis of AD, as each extracerebral organ not only affects brain function through the extracerebral organ-brain axis but also may act through cross-pathways. For instance, gut dysbiosis can disrupt the normal function of the bone and liver, thereby forming a complex, multi-factorial system that synergistically contributes to the onset and progression of AD. It is essential to explore comprehensive, dynamic, and personalized approaches for the treatment of AD tailored to the distinct inter-organ crosstalk profiles of individual patients."

        "title": "Amyloid Beta in Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms, Biomarker Potential, and Therapeutic Targets.",
        "abstract": "MAIN PROBLEMS: The accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of Tau protein is two characteristic brain pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the Aβ hypothesis has recently faced challenges due to the limited clinical efficacy of anti-Aβ antibodies, such as aducanumab and lecanemab. METHODS: This comprehensive review highlights recent advances and debates regarding the pathophysiology of Aβ peptides and plaques in AD, as well as their use as biomarkers and drug targets. RESULTS: Aβ aggregation is primarily driven by an imbalance between its generation from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its clearance from the brain, processes influenced by various risk factors. The toxicity of amyloid plaques is affected by the accumulation of different Aβ species with varying lengths and post-translational modifications of Aβ. Additionally, pathways including neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier deterioration, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid raft changes, and oxidative stress have pivotal roles in AD. Therefore, a clear map of Aβ's upstream regulators and downstream effectors is crucial for developing effective diagnostics and treatments for AD. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating new research findings and ongoing debates surrounding the Aβ cascade hypothesis is crucial for improving early diagnosis and for guiding the development of effective treatments for AD.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition classified as dementia, characterized by the progressive deterioration of memory and cognitive function . Although AD rarely presents in mid‐life, it predominantly affects the elderly, making age a major risk factor for the disease. The exact onset of clinical AD is difficult to ascertain, but subtle and intermittent episodic memory problems are often the earliest symptoms. As the disease progresses, it shifts from declarative to non‐declarative memory impairment, affecting a broad range of cognitive and behavioral processes . AD significantly impacts patients' quality of life and imposes a substantial emotional and financial burden on patients, caregivers, and society as a whole . With increasing life expectancy and an aging population, its prevalence is projected to rise significantly by 2050 . Although there has been notable progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying the disease, effective treatments to halt its progression remain unavailable. Given the significant clinical and financial burden of the disease, there is an urgent need for more effective treatments. Achieving this requires a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways involved, which could enable early detection and the development of better treatment options. The early stage of the disease is believed to result from the age‐related production of a protein called amyloid beta (Aβ) from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and impaired Aβ clearance in the brain. This Aβ pathology is thought to trigger a cascade of events that ultimately produces the AD phenotype . However, a growing body of research underscores the significant contribution of Aβ‐independent mechanisms to the onset and progression of AD . Therefore, advancing beyond the traditional Aβ cascade hypothesis by integrating new insights into AD pathogenesis is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the disease and the development of strategies to slow its progression . This review explores the dual physiological and pathological roles of Aβ, focusing on its interactions with cellular and molecular alterations in AD. It begins by summarizing Aβ's significance in disease progression and its growing utility as a diagnostic biomarker, then provides a critical appraisal of current and emerging Aβ‐targeting therapies, weighing their respective promises and limitations. Finally, the review proposes a pathogenic framework that extends beyond Aβ and Tau pathology and outlines essential future directions for the field.",
        "conclusion": "AD is a complex condition resulting from a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Some of these factors disrupt gene expression, which leads to the production of harmful molecules, triggers inflammation, and initiates other processes that accelerate aging. These processes collectively contribute to the characteristic neuropathology of AD, including the accumulation of Aβ plaques and NFTs. Although Aβ has been central to AD pathogenesis, recent experimental and clinical evidence has challenged this paradigm, and its status as the primary cause of sporadic AD is now debated. Aβ appears to reside within a central signaling pathway that drives neurodegeneration in AD. However, without a clear map of its upstream regulators and downstream effectors, it is impossible to fully unravel the molecular mechanisms that underlie disease pathogenesis and hinder effective diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, the roles of neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, PTMs of Aβ, altered lipid raft composition, and disrupted cholesterol metabolism must now be integrated into a revised model of AD pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment."

        "abstract": "Elderly people over the age of 65 are those most likely to experience Alzheimer's disease (AD), and aging and AD are associated with apparent metabolic alterations. Currently, there is no curative medication against AD and only several drugs have been approved by the FDA, but these drugs can only improve the symptoms of AD. Many preclinical and clinical trials have explored the impact of adjusting the whole-body and intracellular metabolism on the pathogenesis of AD. The most recent evidence suggests that mitochondria initiate an integrated stress response to environmental stress, which is beneficial for healthy aging and neuroprotection. There is also an increasing awareness of the differential risk and potential targeting strategies related to the metabolic level and microbiome. As the main participants in intracellular metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial quality-control mechanisms, and mitochondria-linked inflammatory responses have been regarded as potential therapeutic targets for AD. This review summarizes and highlights these advances.",
        "year": "2023",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37176104/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common and well-known form of dementia, accounting for 60–80% of all cases . Pathologically, brain cells and nerves are damaged by the aggregation of proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation of the brain, forming neural disconnection, neural death and synaptic dysfunction in the brain . Glycolysis and mitochondrial energy synthesis are intertwined in almost all cells and tissues, and together they support metabolism throughout the body. Although the brain is relatively small and isolated by the blood–brain barrier (BBB), the brain consumes approximately 20–25% of body oxygen and glucose . Furthermore, the level of lipid metabolism in the brain is also the highest in the whole body, and its cells use part of the energy to replace the membrane lipid. The metabolic abnormality has been related to AD at the cellular level in the brain and across the entire body. Notably, those with type two diabetes (T2D) appear to be at a higher risk of developing AD . Indeed, people 65 years of age or older have reduced insulin sensitivity . Researchers have found common links between diabetes and AD based on epidemiology studies and investigations of clinical manifestations and mechanisms . For instance, APP/PS1 mice exhibit decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in AD models . Streptozotocin, which has been shown to impair learning and memory and aggravate pathology in AD models, has also been shown to cause diabetes by disrupting pancreatic cell activity . Although the precise molecular mechanism between diabetes and AD is unclear, these observations provide a potential AD treatment perspective. Mitochondria are vital organelles that determine intracellular metabolic pathways, including Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production via electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid β-oxidation, amino acid synthesis, calcium homeostasis, as well as iron metabolism. A high metabolic rate in mitochondria and the availability of oxygen both lead to the production of free radicals and, specifically, reactive oxygen species (ROS); thus, mitochondria are particularly vulnerable to ROS-mediated oxidative damage . Mitochondria are one of the major producers of the ROS of brain cells in a physiological state, predominantly due to the leakage of electrons out of the electron transport chain . In addition to mitochondria, ROS are mostly produced by the NADPH oxidase (NOX) in the cytosol . Mitochondria generate and release pro-apoptotic molecules, particularly cytochrome c (Cyt c), which leads to programmed cell death . Meanwhile, compromised mitochondria can also contribute to other forms of cell death, including necroptosis, ferroptosis, as well as pyroptosis . Notably, abnormalities in the mitochondria’s electron transport chain activities have been seen in AD patients and model organisms. Thus, by focusing on mitochondrial function, homeostasis, and quality-control systems, age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, have been successfully treated. This review will summarize advanced studies of metabolism, mitochondria and their association with AD pathology (Figure 1), and highlight the potential strategies for AD treatment.",
        "conclusion": "A straightforward strategy seems to be glucose supplementation because the bioenergetic system of the brain is affected early in the development of AD and a decline in glucose metabolism and impaired basal metabolism have been widely observed in AD clinical and preclinical trials. However, lower glucose metabolism seems to not relate to decreased circulatory glucose levels and instead, is often associated with increased blood glucose, as in diabetes. Glucose supplementation alone is not a viable strategy for AD treatment. Therefore, enhancing the mitochondrial energy metabolism and improving the impaired brain basal metabolism may be therapeutic strategies. In addition, the targeted normalization of proper mitophagy is believed to be a potent therapeutic design for these diseases. Interestingly, the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in many cases extends lifespan, probably due to the reduced mitochondrial production of reactive species or an adaptive mitotic response to selective stress . For instance, blocking ETC complex I lengthens life expectancy in non-mammalian animals , and several compounds that are beneficial in animal models of AD have been found to have mild complex I inhibitory activity. When mitochondria utilize lipids as a fuel source for ketone bodies, the increased mitochondrial function may accelerate the loss of white matter in the brain, as demonstrated in female animal models of aging and AD; human brain imaging in women also confirmed this phenomenon. Furthermore, increased mitochondrial respiration in microglia may contribute to oxidative stress damage. Therapeutics that target the systemic metabolism and mitochondria in order to enhance the bioenergetic system capacity and mitochondrial function may be able to prevent, postpone, and reverse the negative effects of this important AD driver; however, systemic metabolism and mitochondrial-targeted therapy are difficult due to AD’s complicated and interlocking processes, the disease’s heterologous genetic and environmental causes, and these factors."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable, progressive neurodegenerative disorder. AD is a complex and multifactorial disease that is responsible for 60-80% of dementia cases. Aging, genetic factors, and epigenetic changes are the main risk factors for AD. Two aggregation-prone proteins play a decisive role in AD pathogenesis: β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau). Both of them form deposits and diffusible toxic aggregates in the brain. These proteins are the biomarkers of AD. Different hypotheses have tried to explain AD pathogenesis and served as platforms for AD drug research. Experiments demonstrated that both Aβ and pTau might start neurodegenerative processes and are necessary for cognitive decline. The two pathologies act in synergy. Inhibition of the formation of toxic Aβ and pTau aggregates has been an old drug target. Recently, successful Aβ clearance by monoclonal antibodies has raised new hopes for AD treatments if the disease is detected at early stages. More recently, novel targets, e.g., improvements in amyloid clearance from the brain, application of small heat shock proteins (Hsps), modulation of chronic neuroinflammation by different receptor ligands, modulation of microglial phagocytosis, and increase in myelination have been revealed in AD research.",

        "introduction": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) represent a big part of neurological disorders. NDDs are characterized by the loss of synapses and neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuronal loss often generates the decline of cognitive functions and dementia. Many NDDs have a common central neuropathological event: misfolded, toxic protein aggregates (amyloids) are accumulated in the CNS. NDDs can be regarded as protein homeostasis disorders: the level of several aggregation-prone proteins is increased, and subsequent small conformational changes result in the accumulation of pathogenic, β-structured amyloid proteins. Many amyloid protein structures are self-replicating, display prionoid character, and their aggregated form is propagated from cell to cell (transmissible pathology) . The prionoid propagation of several amyloids (e.g., tau protein and α-synuclein) has been proven. The precise molecular mechanism of the conversion of a nontransmissible protein to the pathogenic prionoid form is not completely understood. Although the native, functionally-folded proteins possess important physiological functions, their misfolded amyloid aggregates are toxic to brain cells. The amyloid structure fundamentally differs from the globular state of these proteins and has remarkable similarities in the molecular and supramolecular organization . Medical research has revealed common disease pathways among NDDs ; the most important of them is the accumulation of toxic, misfolded proteins. Distinct NDDs are coupled to the accumulation of different misfolded amyloid proteins: AD to β-amyloid (Aβ), hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) and other proteins, Parkinson’s disease (PD) to α-synuclein (α-syn), Huntington’s disease (HD) to huntingtin, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to SOD-1 or TDP-43, and prion diseases to prion proteins. Amyloid accumulation may also occur in the parenchymal organs of the periphery (e.g., heart and kidneys) and cause the progress of serious diseases. Existing treatments for NDDs are limited and mainly address symptoms rather than causes of the disease. Very recent studies have shown that these diseases are complex and multifactorial, presenting hurdles for discovering novel therapies. In the recent genomic era, novel experimental results have opened up the opportunity for using genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics, and lipidomic data for designing novel drugs for the treatment of NDDs. Developing preventive and, ultimately, disease-modifying therapies for slowing the progression of neurodegeneration in AD and other NDDs seems to be one of the greatest medical needs of our time. The present review first summarizes our most important knowledge of AD (pathology, genetic background, different hypotheses of the progression of AD, and novel methods for early diagnosis). In the second part, we show novel targets for preventing and/or slowing the progress of AD (e.g., increase in amyloid clearance, inhibition of amyloid formation and accumulation, and modulation of neuroinflammation).",
        "conclusion": "An old dream has been to find a master gene or gene combination whose modulation would slow down the aging process, thereby helping to avoid age-related dementia. This type of master gene has not been found yet. AD drug research has reached a turning point now. The novel targets for biomarker and drug research are not amyloid plaques but intracellular proteins (iAβ and oTau) or biochemical pathways. The newest approaches of precise fluid biomarker determinations by cheap clinical mass spectrometry provide a means for the diagnosis of MCI and AD in a large population. It has been widely accepted in recent years that both amyloids (Aβ and pTau assemblies) participate in the progress of AD. In addition, a drug combination ought to be used for reversing MCI or slowing down the development of AD. Novel protein targets (e.g., medin, BSN, PAR-5) should be used for the prevention of amyloid overproduction and the formation of toxic assemblies. Small molecular inducers of small, neuroprotective Hsps (e.g., crystallines: Hsp B4/5) will be used for inhibiting the formation of toxic amyloid aggregates. Increased Aβ clearance with the help of monoclonal Abs might be reached by increasing the penetration of big proteins across the BBB and the cell membrane by specific transporters. Special drugs may be developed to augment the effectivity of oAβ and oTau clearance by the BBB and the glymphatic system from the aging brain. The dangerous effect of chronic inflammation on neuronal death might be inhibited via novel anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., Sig-1R ligands). Microglia, a double-edged sword in the maintenance of brain homeostasis in a suitable form, might be ideal for phagocytotic clearance of brain waste. Identification of the biochemical markers of activated microglia and the main mediators of neuroinflammation provide novel methods for the selective manipulation of microglia in the future. Novel approaches using rejuvenated immune cells and glial phagocytosis by astrocyte-like Bergman glial cells might also increase Aβ clearance. Regulation of ApoE4 effect on cholesterol transport and myelination may help AD patients who have a special ApoE4 gene signature. It is expected that physical methods, e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, may also prove to be successful in treating AD. Currently, there are over 120 different potential new medications for AD in clinical trials. We conclude that over 30 years of intensive experimental work has not provided a genuine breakthrough in AD treatment. A good and suitable animal model of AD for preclinical experiments would be needed. Development of such kind of rodent model mimicking the changes during aging (BBB dysfunction, decreasing Aβ clearance, Aβ and tau overproduction, and NI) could be reached by transgenic techniques . The efficacy of Aβ binding mAbs will be improved during the next years, but their disadvantage is that they only target the extracellular amyloid plaques. The spectrum of drug targets should be widened. The development of small molecular oral agents for intracellular targets and biological processes (amyloid aggregation, clearance, Hsp, autophagy induction, inflammasomes, etc.) will be the focus of future AD drug research. The development of β- and γ-secretase inhibitors will be abandoned. In the near future, the selection of endangered individuals using genome sequencing and the identification of bad genetic signatures may become feasible. The earliest possible diagnosis (latest in MCI stage) will be necessary for successful AD treatment as aging is the most important risk factor of AD. We suggest that a single drug cannot be expected to treat all stages of AD. A drug combination strategy with multiple molecular targets should be considered. It may take a couple of years to developing successful AD treatments."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug discovery has focused on a set of highly studied therapeutic hypotheses, with limited success. The heterogeneous nature of AD processes suggests that a more diverse, systems-integrated strategy may identify new therapeutic hypotheses. Although many target hypotheses have arisen from systems-level modeling of human disease, in practice and for many reasons, it has proven challenging to translate them into drug discovery pipelines. First, many hypotheses implicate protein targets and/or biological mechanisms that are under-studied, meaning there is a paucity of evidence to inform experimental strategies as well as high-quality reagents to perform them. Second, systems-level targets are predicted to act in concert, requiring adaptations in how we characterize new drug targets.

        "introduction": "By 2050, Alzheimer's disease (AD) will affect 150 million people worldwide. Caring for these patients will exact a tremendous societal and economic toll, 1 especially because there is a paucity of efficacious disease‐modifying therapies approved for use in humans. The past two decades of drug discovery efforts in AD have been focused on a few therapeutic hypotheses. Although these were strongly supported by genetic evidence, none have been validated in patients. 2 There is, therefore, an urgent need to explore new target hypotheses, which will necessitate adopting a higher risk tolerance in our target selection and drug discovery strategies. To this end, the National Institute on Aging has launched an initiative, called TREAT‐AD (TaRget Enablement to Accelerate Therapy Development for AD). The goals of this program are to provide the community with a set of high‐quality core reagents that are needed to explore new targets or disease mechanisms, and to pursue the most promising by generating new high‐quality pharmacological tools that are active in animals (drug leads). TREAT‐AD comprises two centers. Each is a collective of institutions; one is led from the Indiana University School of Medicine and the other from Emory University (and includes Sage Bionetworks and the Structural Genomics Consortium [SGC]). Here we describe the strategy of the Emory‐Sage‐SGC TREAT‐AD Center to enable rapid diversification of the AD drug discovery pipeline and apply the strategy to targets suggested by systems‐level approaches. Unbiased genome‐wide studies from genetics and systems biology have led to an abundance of novel disease‐associated proteins and pathways that have not been studied previously in relation to AD and may provide for new therapeutic hypotheses. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage: an advantage in that the approaches offer the potential for truly transformative ideas, but a disadvantage in that the research enterprise is reticent to work on previously understudied proteins. 3 In AD, this phenomenon is particularly true, and can be quantified by evaluating the publication intensity over time for the 184 genes reported as associated with AD risk (ie, “AD‐related genes”) in the National Human Genome Research Institute ‐ European Bioinformatics Institute (NHGRI‐EBI) Unbiased genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) catalog through 2015 4 (Figure 1). Specifically, we quantified the publications that mention both Alzheimer's and the gene or protein name in the keywords, abstract, or title in two time periods: before genetic association studies were published (1950–2000) and after these studies were published (2018–2020). As might be expected, prior to 2000 almost all of the AD gene‐based publications (93%) were focused on four genes (apolipoprotein E [APOE], amyloid precursor protein [APP], presenilin 1 [PSEN1], and presenilin 2 [PSEN2]) that were discovered through early‐onset familial AD studies. But despite strengthening evidence from clinical trials that some anti‐amyloid immunotherapies informed by these four genes/proteins have only small although significant benefit in at least a subset of AD cases, 5 clearly more robust therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Nonetheless, these four genes remained the most studied genes in the 2018–2020 period, garnering fully 73% of the AD‐related gene publications. In contrast, the number of genes associated with AD risk continues to explode with larger well‐powered studies, with at least 75 gene associations confirmed—most with links to additional, understudied biology. 6 In our center, we hypothesize that researchers will be more willing to devote attention to understudied genes and proteins if provided with open access to high‐quality molecular and cellular research tools, 3 and our aim is to generate these tools for under‐studied proteins linked to AD.",
        "conclusion": "The primary aim of this work is to increase the numbers of new targets considered in AD drug discovery pipelines by providing the community with the TEPs and drug‐like tools necessary to carry out robust target characterization. The TREAT‐AD program is the early translational partner of the NIA Translational Research Program and, so, operates on target priorities identified within this ecosystem. Reagents developed through TREAT‐AD are designed to uncover new biology, invalidate some target hypotheses, and increase the scientific attention on lesser‐studied human proteins and other targets. This alone will be a tremendous contribution to AD research. If one of the targets proves promising and advances into drug discovery and development, then its impact would extend from basic understanding to translational medicine. Our center is designed as a community resource. As such, we actively solicit input on experimental prioritization from domain experts and promote the use of center outputs, in particular to test emergent therapeutic hypotheses. To encourage use by others, all available TREAT‐AD resources, including TEP reports, are cataloged in the AD Knowledge Portal 8 (Figure 3). An overview of the full TREAT‐AD portfolio, including resources currently in development, can be found on the TREAT‐AD website. 20 We are committed to generating high‐quality probes that can be applied alongside an appropriate suite of reagents to enable discoveries about fundamental biology and validate the roles of these and other potential emerging AD targets. We will continue to make resources available and to collaborate widely with the research community—and we call on the community to use these reagents and engage with us to guide future reagent development."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive loss of cognition and a gradual decrease in memory. Although AD is considered the most persistent form of dementia and a global concern, no complete cure or agents that can completely halt the progression of AD have been found. In the past years, significant progress has been made in understanding the cellular and molecular changes associated with AD, and numerous drug targets have been identified for the development of drugs for this disease. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are the major attributes of AD. Symptomatic relief is the only possible treatment available at present and a disease-modifying drug is of utmost importance. The development of drugs that can inhibit different targets responsible for the formation of plaques is a potential area in AD research. This review is not a complete list of all possible targets for AD but serves to highlight the targets related to Aβ pathology and pathways concerned with the formation of Aβ fragments. This shall serve as a prospect in the identification of Aβ plaque inhibitors and pave the strategies for newer drug treatments. Nevertheless, substantial research is done in this area but to bridle, the clinical difficulty remains a concern.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neuronal disorder that develops with age and leads to cognitive decline and thinking skills. AD has been a global concern for years, comprising 60–80% of dementia cases (Ashraf et al., 2016). The Alzheimer’s association estimated that 10 million around the globe are affected by AD and the number is on the rise. India is ranked third highest in the caseload related to dementia and particularly in AD after China and the US. According to statistics, the population of the elderly in India will reach around 300 million, accounting for almost 20% of the total population of the country. The expected rise of AD patients in the world by 2050 would be from 1.6 million cases in 2015 to 4.6 million cases by 2050 (Edwards, 2019; Madav et al., 2019; Rizzi et al., 2014; Soto et al., 2007). Pathologically, AD is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, which are first seen in the cortex and hippocampus. This induces neuronal injury resulting in neuronal death and successively damaging the cholinergic transmission leading to loss of memory and cognition along with neurotransmitter abnormalities (Benny & Thomas, 2019; Chaudhary et al., 2018; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019; Shankarappa et al., 2012). Over the years, advances in the field of pathogenesis have inspired researchers to identify novel therapies concentrated more on the pathological aspects of the disease. Although the exact root cause of AD remains unclear, several factors play a major role in the progression of the disease (Madav et al., 2019). The various hypotheses developed for the pathogenesis of AD are included in Figure 1. The Aβ hypothesis remains the most studied area of AD pathology and the preferred target for drug development. The proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is said to be the central dogma of this hypothesis. APP is a transmembrane protein located on chromosome 21 in humans and is expressed in the brain at high levels and is metabolized rapidly. APP is mainly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and then moves to the Golgi network where it plays a role in neural growth and repair. The proteolysis of APP occurs by amyloidogenic (pathogenic) or the non-amyloidogenic (non-pathogenic) pathway. The amyloidogenic pathway releases insoluble Aβ peptides and the aggregation of these peptides leads to plaque formation (Du et al., 2018; Edwards, 2019; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011).",
        "conclusion": "Several studies support the amyloidal theory that Aβ is the starter to a complex number of pathological events in the brain concerning AD. Aβ starts to emerge long before the clinical symptoms appear physically. The deposition of Aβ not only causes hindrance to the signaling system but also triggers cerebral deficits, calcium homeostasis, and cognition problems. Unfortunately, the research on Aβ plaques as a target for AD has been on a downward graph because of the failure of drugs in clinical trials. Even so, the re-launch of aducanumab as an anti-amyloid drug has stirred up this theory once again. The difficulty in pacing up with molecular knowledge is still evident as we still depend heavily on classical pathology. However, studies are done at a faster pace to identify the exact pathology behind AD suggesting that it is feasible to provide new targets for drug discovery and development directed toward the Aβ accumulation. In this article, we listed down the targets that play various roles in plaque formation, which could help design effective drugs for AD. The best possible way to eliminate Aβ pathology is to prevent it from accumulating in the brain. The outcome that occurs on removing these pathological lesions in AD patients should be intensely focussed in the research studies."

        "abstract": "The brain contains approximately 100 billion neurons and over 200 billion glial cells, which are integral to the neuronal networks that support normal brain function in the central nervous system. The complexity of the brain makes the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease particularly challenging. Neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. Dementia refers to a decline in memory and thinking ability, affecting approximately 55 million people worldwide. Owing to the association of multiple factors, including amyloid-β plaque, tau-fibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, nutritional defects, and genetic mutations, the exact cause of the most common type of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, remains elusive. These multiple factors may cause damage to neurons and glial cells, leading to neurodegeneration. Very few therapeutics are available for neurodegenerative diseases due to the limited understanding of their pathogenesis, resulting in the lack of biomarkers and drug targets. Recent attention has shifted toward addressing modifiable risk factors such as unhealthy diets and lifestyles to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Unhealthy diets that consist of saturated fatty acids and refined sugars, with other multiple risk factors, increase neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, furthering cognitive decline and progression of neurodegeneration. Mitigating these risk factors with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory-based nutrition, and multidomain lifestyle intervention, which may include physical exercise, cognitive stimulation, and social engagement, may delay the development of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. In this review, we focus on the role of neuroinflammation in contributing to neurodegeneration and dietary influence in Alzheimer's disease.",

        "introduction": "Neurons and glial cells construct neural networks and synapses, maintaining a healthy microenvironment within the brain. Glial cells provide essential support for the axonal function and synaptic plasticity of neurons, and they participate as integral mediators of neuronal networks in the central nervous system (CNS) (1, 2). Specifically, astrocytes and microglia are the primary supporting glial cells in the CNS, where they respond to stress, infection, and injury, and survey the microenvironment (3). Neurodegeneration is the progressive loss of functional neurons, often triggered by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, glial activation, and cerebrovascular damage. It ultimately results in neuronal cell death and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The pathological features of these diseases include inflammation, genetic defects, altered energy metabolism, abnormalities in cytoskeletal structure and proteostasis, synaptic network defects, and pathological protein aggregation (4). Neuroinflammation is triggered by various insults, including infection, toxic metabolites, stress, or metabolic disturbances, which activate microglia to a proinflammatory stage, resulting in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Without clinical interventions, neuroinflammation can lead to neurodegeneration, disability, and, ultimately, death. Although the causes and pathological mechanisms of AD are not yet clearly identified, many associated causes and noticeable pathologies of AD have been established. The three major pathologies in AD patients are (i) accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) particles in the brain, (ii) tubulin associated unit (tau) fibrillation in the neurons, and (iii) hyperactivated microglia and neuroinflammation in the brain (5, 6). The risk factors of AD include non-modifiable and modifiable factors, and the synergistic effects of these risk factors contribute to the development of AD (7). It is particularly crucial to address modifiable risk factors such as unhealthy diets and lifestyles to delay the development of AD. The current stage of AD research and the remaining questions are briefly reviewed, followed by an examination of neuroinflammation and the interactions between microglial activation and neuronal cell health in AD. Moreover, we examine well-established diets to delay and/or reduce the risk of AD. Finally, we review emerging gut microbiome research and the modulation of brain health through the regulation of communication between the gut and the brain. We aim to highlight the impact of healthy diets on AD and improved neuronal health.",
        "conclusion": "AD is the most common type of dementia, accounting for over 120,000 deaths in the US in 2022 (85). The exact cause of the disease is still unclear. Still, many research efforts point to multiple risk factors such as genetics, age, neuroinflammation, and unhealthy diet and lifestyle contributing to AD development. Limited treatments are available to delay AD development, such as small molecules (e.g., glutamate modulators, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) to improve synaptic function and immunotherapy (e.g., anti-Aβ: lecanemab, donanemab, or anti-β/γ-secretases) to remove plaques and reduce tau tangles, but have had modest success (7, 8, 86, 87). The development of AD therapeutics is hindered by a lack of understanding of the causes of AD, the few diagnostic tools for early diagnosis, and difficulties in creating biomimetic clinical disease models (88). For example, the tau transgenic mice have significant limitations in accurately recapitulating the complexity of human tauopathy, such as age-dependent, anatomical changes seen in human AD (27). Emerging diagnostic technologies may help alleviate this situation, for example, blood tests based on Aβ and p-tau217 proteins have successfully predicted AD diagnosis with 88–92% accuracy (89). Alternative 3D human in vitro AD models that maintain spatial geometry and neuron-glial cell interactions seen in the human brain are being developed (90, 91). In addition, 3D human brain organoids provided the spatial architecture of the brain and enabled cell–cell interactions, recapitulating the neuron-glial cellular network (91). Identification of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD using biomimetic 3D human in vitro/organoid models may provide opportunities for better drug development (92). Neuroinflammation acts as a double-edged sword in AD, providing beneficial anti-inflammatory and detrimental proinflammatory effects. In AD mouse models, depletion of microglia by inhibitors of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor has been shown to reduce plaque accumulation, neuroinflammation, and improve cognition (93, 94). TREM2-activating antibodies can enhance microglial phagocytosis, leading to increased microglial activity around amyloid plaques and improved cognition in AD mice (95). Therefore, modulating neuroinflammation by timely regulation of microglial function using targeted anti-inflammatory drugs may be a practical approach to treating AD patients. Addressing modifiable risk factors of AD may help improve cognitive health. A diet that enhances anti-inflammatory and antioxidant function, as well as cardiac health, is one of the most significant modifiable factors. MeDi, DASH, MIND, and MMKD diets may promote anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, neuroprotection, and contribute to healthy aging. The oral and gut microbiome can trigger inflammation in the brain, increase BBB permeability, and amyloid plaque deposition, contributing to AD pathogenesis (96, 97). Maintaining a healthy oral and gut microbiome with prebiotics and probiotics will be crucial in delaying the onset of AD."

        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35911597/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating illness which afflicts millions worldwide, but no effective treatment exists. This is partly due to the lack of understanding of the molecular basis behind the disease. Presently, AD pathology is typically characterized by an abnormal accumulation of β-amyloid in plaques and phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles leading to neurodegeneration including synaptic and neuronal loss. Support for a role of β-amyloid comes from genetic risk factors—mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes lead to β-amyloid accumulation and confer risk to early-onset AD (Goate et al., 1972; Levy-Lahad et al., 1995; Sherrington et al., 1995; Tanzi, 2012). However, despite this accumulation, β-amyloid plaques correlate poorly with memory decline (Giannakopoulos et al., 2003; Ingelsson et al., 2004). Interestingly, this correlation does improve for soluble amyloid (Tomic et al., 2009). In contrast, while a genetic linkage is not established between genes associated with processing tau and AD (Goedert, 2005), its accumulation in neurofibrillary tangles has a strong correlation with neurodegeneration and memory decline (Duyckaerts et al., 1998; Giannakopoulos et al., 2003; Ingelsson et al., 2004). Diagnosis of AD requires the presence of both β-amyloid and tau accumulations, although the mechanisms by which they produce neurodegeneration remain unknown (van der Kant et al., 2020), and attempts to treat AD by targeting β-amyloid and tau pathology have been unsuccessful in showing conclusive cognitive improvement (Kametani and Hasegawa, 2018). Even FDA-approved amyloid clearance that is thought to address amyloid (including soluble amyloid) does not have a clear clinical benefit (Knopman et al., 2020). Thus, β-amyloid and tau do not seem to provide a complete explanation of the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Recent work suggests that microglial inflammation also plays an important role in AD, and may link β-amyloid and tau pathology with neurodegeneration. Genetic analyses demonstrated increased AD risk associated with inflammation-related genes including TREM2 (Guerreiro et al., 2013; Jonsson et al., 2013), CD33 (Bradshaw et al., 2013; Griciuc et al., 2013), and microglia genes (Sims et al., 2017). Gene expression studies show AD associated remodeling of microglial gene regulatory networks (Zhang et al., 2013) and increased hippocampal major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II expression localized to AD microglia, which was inversely correlated with cognitive ability (Parachikova et al., 2007). Furthermore, evidence shows microglia interact extensively with β-amyloid and tau. In vivo preclinical models demonstrate that microglia phagocytize injected fibrillary amyloid (Geula et al., 1998; Weldon et al., 1998), β-amyloid plaques increase microglial reactivity, and soluble amyloid oligomers can activate microglia (Yang et al., 2017). Depletion of murine microglia can also reduce the trans-synaptic spread of tau (Asai et al., 2015). Additionally, the importance of inflammation is suggested by cellular responses—pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in AD (Morimoto et al., 2011). Iron is a key component of inflammation; thus, it is of direct importance to AD. Additionally, it is important in many other fundamental biological processes in the brain including oxygen transportation, DNA synthesis, mitochondrial respiration, myelin synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism (Ward et al., 2014). As early as 1953, abnormal iron accumulation in the hippocampus has been associated with AD (Goodman, 1953). Since then, much work has been done examining the role of iron and iron homeostasis in relation to AD pathology. In this review, we will present the existing evidence and mechanistic insights of iron involvement in AD, and discuss novel imaging tools and peripheral measures available to characterize iron accumulation and dysregulation in AD.",
        "conclusion": "The literature supports iron’s involvement in AD—evidence of iron alterations has been consistently observed ex vivo, with histology, biological techniques, and imaging, and in vivo, with MR and biofluid measures. Despite the evidence presented here that iron accumulation and dysregulation is a hallmark feature in the AD brain, it remains an outstanding question whether it is simply the result of other underlying pathologic drivers (which may make it a good biomarker of disease, but not a therapeutically relevant target) or if it has a causative role in driving neurodegeneration (with potential for targeted therapies). There exists limited evidence supporting iron as a causative factor in AD. Proteomic studies show that binding of ferrous iron to β-amyloid peptides facilitates aggregation through formation of β-sheet structures (Boopathi and Kolandaivel, 2016). In vitro work has also suggested a causative role for iron in the formation of β-amyloid aggregates—treatment of neurons with ferric citrate facilitated non-amyloidogenic processing of APP (Chen et al., 2018). Similarly, treatment of β-amyloid peptides with ferric citrate promotes aggregation (Galante et al., 2018) and iron chelation decreases it (Tahmasebinia and Emadi, 2017). In vivo, increasing the brain iron of APP mice through dietary overload has been shown to potentiate iron accumulation in amyloid plaques and microgliosis (Peters et al., 2016). It is important to note, however, that there are distinct contrasts between human AD brain tissue and the APP mouse model—iron distribution, iron management, and glial response histologically differ between the two (Meadowcroft et al., 2015). However, further research with preclinical AD models and clinical trials of iron modulation in humans are needed to potentially provide evidence for a mechanistic link between iron and Alzheimer’s pathology and progression. Advances in MRI to increase accuracy and specificity of iron detection may possibly reveal early AD pathology. Initial work has demonstrated the potential of in vivo MRI techniques to detect iron deposition and dysregulation in AD. Leveraging ultra-high-field (7T) MRI systems, which can produce images with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution than lower-field strength MR systems (1.5T, 3T), may provide additional research and clinical benefit. These systems are being used to elucidate novel insights into the pathology of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases ex vivo (de Reuck et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2014; Zucca et al., 2016; Kenkhuis et al., 2019). These findings have led to a growing number of in vivo studies performed at 7T, where increased resolution of structural and functional scans has led to enhanced visualization of microstructures (Deistung et al., 2013; Bianciardi et al., 2018) and novel networks of brain connectivity (Muckli et al., 2015), enabling insights into the pathology of a range of neurological diseases (de Graaf et al., 2012; van Veluw et al., 2013; Harrison et al., 2015; de Ciantis et al., 2016; Obusez et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2019). In AD, high-resolution 7T brain imaging, when compared to 3T, has made several advancements in our understanding of disease pathology and pathogenesis and may potentially improve timely diagnosis and management (Yedavalli et al., 2021). 7T imaging can be used alongside β-amyloid PET-MR and tau PET-MR for a full analysis of AD pathology in vivo. However, high SNR and resolution requires long scan times resulting in image artifacts caused by patient motion, which limits the clinical interpretability of images and the reliability of quantitative analyses, such as segmentations that estimate volume and thickness. Thus, work is being done to accelerate scans (Uðurbil et al., 2019) or implement motion correction systems (DiGiacomo et al., 2020). Additionally, while evidence of iron dysregulation has been seen with peripheral measures, the current data have not translated to strong diagnostic or prognostic markers. Extracellular vesicles such as exosomes, which have been linked to AD spread and progression in preclinical models (Gallart-Palau et al., 2020) and AD-derived cells (Ruan et al., 2021), have also been shown to transport iron (Truman-Rosentsvit et al., 2018) and increase its export in order to lower oxidative stress and inhibit ferroptosis (Brown et al., 2019). Hence, they are being increasingly studied as AD biomarkers (Malm et al., 2016; Quek and Hill, 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Hornung et al., 2020). Iron related proteins found in exosomes include: transferrin and its receptor (Harding et al., 1983; Pan and Johnstone, 1983), ferritin (Truman-Rosentsvit et al., 2018), ceruloplasmin (Gudehithlu et al., 2019), lactoferrin (Wu and Liu, 2018), melanotransferrin (Greening et al., 2016), DMT-1 (Mackenzie et al., 2016), hepcidin (Sasaki et al., 2019), and ferroportin (Chawla et al., 2019). Extracellular vesicles may thus play a role in iron or iron-related protein and RNA (inter-cellular) transport, in neurodegeneration and specifically in AD (Zhang et al., 2021), though their importance in iron-related pathways in AD remains to be investigated. Further investigation of iron in AD can elucidate the mechanisms behind AD pathogenesis and progression, while also allowing potential for translation to clinical applications using iron as an AD biomarker or even therapeutic target."

The disease is pathologically characterised by the accumulation and aggregation of an extracellular peptide referred to as amyloid-β (Aβ) in the form of amyloid plaques and the intracellular aggregation of a hyperphosphorelated protein tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that cause neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and oxidative stress. The search for pathomechanisms leading to disease onset and progression has identified many key players that include genetic, epigenetic, behavioural, and environmental factors, which lend support to the fact that this is a multi-faceted disease where failure in various systems contributes to disease onset and progression. Although the vast majority of individuals present with the sporadic (non-genetic) form of the disease, dysfunctions in numerous protein-coding and non-coding genes have been implicated in mechanisms contributing to the disease. Recent studies have provided strong evidence for the association of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with AD. In this review, we highlight the current findings on changes observed in circular RNA (circRNA), microRNA (miRNA), short interfering RNA (siRNA), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in AD. Variations in these ncRNAs could potentially serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We also discuss the results of studies that have targeted these ncRNAs in cellular and animal models of AD with a view for translating these findings into therapies for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic degenerative condition of the central nervous system (CNS) that manifests mainly as dementia. It is the most common form of dementia and affects memory and higher executive functions, including learning, comprehension, language, and judgment, generally without effects on consciousness. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the cause of AD are still unknown. It is, however, clear that AD is a heterogeneous disease with a multifaceted etiology that includes genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors acting in concert to dysregulate homeostatic mechanisms and propagate the onset and development of the disease. The extracellular aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides and the intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein within the CNS are the most widely studied and recognised pathological features in AD development, while neural network and vascular theories for AD onset and development are also being actively explored . Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy, non-coding RNAs, and neuroinflammation are other processes for which new evidence of their integral roles in AD pathogenesis is constantly being discovered, further strengthening the fact that the etiological factors involved in the disease process are heterogeneous and work in concert until the final disease pathway is fully established. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a diverse family of non-protein-coding RNA transcripts that, due to their critical regulatory actions in multiple biological processes and disease development, are potentially useful as therapeutic targets and biomarkers for a range of physiological and pathological conditions . This family of RNA molecules includes microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), small interfering RNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs), and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that interact with other RNAs, DNA, and proteins through their primary sequence and structural elements. These ncRNAs regulate biological processes including transcription, RNA turnover, translation, and post-translational assembly of proteins . As mentioned, ncRNAs have been reported to play pivotal roles in the pathophysiologic processes that promote the onset and development of many diseases, including Alzheimer’s , and therefore represent potentially useful and novel therapeutic targets and disease biomarkers. In this review, we aim to highlight the current knowledge of how various ncRNAs influence pathophysiologic mechanisms and processes in AD and how these molecules may be harnessed for clinical and therapeutic benefits. The central dogma or tenet of molecular biology, as developed from studies of simpler organisms, is that DNA acts as a template for the transcription of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which in turn serve as templates for the production of proteins via the processes of translation. Emerging research has consistently revealed an increasing number of exceptions to this rule, i.e., RNA types that do not encode for proteins, especially in more complex living organisms. These RNA molecules include the traditionally known classes of RNAs involved in translation, such as transfer RNAs (those that carry amino acids and are involved in the synthesis of proteins), ribosomal RNAs (RNAs involved in forming the machinery for protein synthesis), small nuclear RNAs, which are involved in splicing events involving mRNA transcripts, and small nucleolar RNAs that are critically involved in the chemical modification of other smaller RNAs such as ribosomal and transfer RNAs. Non-coding RNAs are broadly classified as either housekeeping or regulatory ncRNAs. Regulatory ncRNAs have been categorised based on their length into short-chain ncRNAs that include circular RNAs, short-interfering RNAs, microRNAs, and piwi-associated RNAs, and long ncRNA (lncRNA) . As the name suggests, regulatory RNAs act as important regulators of gene expression in many essential cellular systems and biochemical interactions. Long non-coding RNA refers to species longer than 200 nucleotides in length and is known to play roles in biological processes, including epigenetic control of chromatin modification, mRNA stability, promoter-specific regulation of genes, the inactivation/lyonization of X-chromosomes, and imprinting .",
        "conclusion": "Non-coding RNAs perform critical regulatory functions in a wide range of cell types. Via epigenetic mechanisms and by regulating the expression of a number of genes, ncRNAs exert influence over a potentially wide range of cellular processes that depend on the expression and function of a large number of proteins. The wide-ranging effects of ncRNAs on normal cell function imply that their actions and dysregulation could have important roles in the onset and progression of many human diseases. Non-coding RNAs have been found to play important roles in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, with recent studies in cellular and animal models as well as human brain tissue, serum, and CSF studies shedding light on some of these roles. MicroRNAs, circular RNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs, small interfering RNAs, and long non-coding RNAs have all been implicated in amyloid plaque formation and accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and many other important pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease onset and progression. Many of these studies also reveal that some non-coding RNAs can be manipulated in AD, with potential therapeutic changes to the pathophysiological process. In addition, due to changes in the expression pattern of many non-coding RNAs at different stages of the disease, non-coding RNAs may also be useful as biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease, and a number of studies have generated results that support this idea. Using non-coding RNAs as biomarkers for AD may significantly improve early detection and ultimately result in better clinical outcomes resulting from earlier intervention. Although significant strides have been made in the study of the roles that non-coding RNAs play in AD pathogenesis, much still remains unknown with regard to the exact mechanistic nature of their pathophysiological roles and their potential as therapeutic options and biomarkers. More detailed studies on the properties of many non-coding RNAs, the exact roles that they play in AD progression, and how they play these roles will lead to the discovery of new biomarkers and viable therapeutic strategies for the disease, which will improve prognosis and outcomes for patients."

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a diverse group of neurological disorders characterized by alterations in the structure and function of the central nervous system. Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by impaired memory and cognitive abilities, is the most prevalent type of senile dementia. Loss of synapses, intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and extracellular amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) plaques are the hallmarks of AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules that bind to the 3' and 5' untranslated regions of target genes to cause post-transcriptional gene silencing. The brain expresses over 70% of all experimentally detected miRNAs, and these miRNAs are crucial for synaptic function and particular signals during memory formation. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs play a role in AD pathogenesis and we provide an overview of the role of miRNAs in synapse formation, Aβ synthesis, tau protein accumulation, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-associated AD pathogenesis. We further summarize and discuss the role of miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for AD detection and differentiation between early- and late-stage AD, based on recent research. In conclusion, altered expression of miRNAs in the brain and peripheral circulation demonstrates their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in AD.",

        "introduction": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) represent a significant mental health threat, and are primarily characterized by neuronal loss . Despite decades of research, researchers are still searching for potential treatments for these illnesses. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is closely linked to aging, is the most prevalent NDD, representing the fifth leading cause of death and the primary cause of dementia globally . Currently, approximately 55 million people worldwide suffer from AD, and this number doubles every 5 years . By 2050, approximately 152 million patients are projected to be affected with AD worldwide, with developing nations predicted to experience the largest growth in this number . In affluent nations, over 10% of older (over 65 years of age) individuals have early stage AD, and over 33% of very old (aged > 85 years) individuals may have advanced AD symptoms and indications . Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent form of NDD, which progresses to dementia and cognitive deterioration . From a pathological perspective, AD is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and plaques of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, leakage of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), neuronal loss, and degeneration . According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the major proteolytic fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, Aβ, is the fundamental factor in AD pathogenesis. APP is a single-pass type I membrane protein that has a large extracellular domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, and is found in the somatodendritic and axonal compartments of neurons . Embedded within neurons, misfolded tau protein is the second most important histopathological feature of AD, and is the major cause of tauopathy . The microtubule-associated protein family includes phosphoprotein tau, which is mostly located in axons and, to a lesser extent, in glial cells and somatodendritic compartments. Tau facilitates axonal transit and dendritic organization, in addition to stabilizing and assembling microtubules . Consequently, tau hyperphosphorylation results in the loss of its native function, which ultimately causes deficits in dendritic structure, axonal trafficking, microtube construction, the loss of synapses, neuronal death, and dementia. Prefibrillar aggregates, such as Aβ, are the cause of tau-mediated neurotoxicity . Phosphorylated tau further aggregates to undergo oligomerization before developing into paired helical straight filaments . Although no disease-modifying medication is available to reverse AD, some therapies may lessen the behavioral and cognitive symptoms of patients with AD. The late or final stage of AD is the primary challenge in AD treatment . Therefore, to improve treatment outcomes, highly sensitive, easy-to-diagnose, and noninvasive peripheral blood-based biomarkers are needed. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), whole blood, and plasma are the most appropriate fluids for biomarker detection. To date, both Aβ protein, which produces plaques, and phosphorylated tau, a key component of NFTs, have long been recognized as the two pathological hallmarks of AD ; however, both of these have some limitations in terms of their utility in early diagnosis, such as the sensitivity of instruments required to measure these proteins in the blood and CSF, and due to the peripheral production of Aβ, there is significant overlap between diagnostic groups . Recently, numerous studies have examined the relationship between NDDs and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) . MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are two of the most important regulatory ncRNAs involved in central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Various biological processes, including brain development, maturation, differentiation, neuronal cell specification, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission, are regulated by several types of ncRNAs, and growing evidence has shown that the onset of AD is strongly correlated with miRNAs and lncRNAs . The finding that miRNAs disrupt the expression of the genes implicated in AD has further prompted their application as therapeutic agents . It has also been shown that miRNAs have great promise as therapeutic targets in different regions of the brain; however, further research is needed to fully comprehend the role and mode of action of miRNAs in the CNS . To investigate the functions of miRNAs in AD, researchers have applied both conventional genetic and viral overexpression techniques . Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in the CSF are key indicators for early diagnosis . miRNAs are the most extensively researched exRNA species found in circulating fluids, including the CSF, saliva, serum, and urine . Conventionally, Northern blot methods, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarrays, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and deep sequencing have all been used to quantify and identify miRNAs . However, these methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and require expensive supplies and equipment as well as skilled individuals for testing . Nevertheless, they are sophisticated and exhibit good sensitivity and high specificity. Therefore, the development of alternative, affordable, and effective procedures is crucial for the detection and treatment of diseases, including AD . A comprehensive evaluation of the current status of biosensor-based methods for amplification-free miRNA detection is also needed. According to current trends, biosensor-based methods for miRNA testing will supplement molecular methods because of their benefits, including amplification-free detection, femtomolar–attomolar LOD, multiplexing ability, and low sample preparation requirements . Novel, noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are all needed to enable the early diagnosis and precision medicine management of AD . Various studies have shown the potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic roles of miRNAs , as shown in Figure 1. Hence, in this review, we summarize the involvement of miRNAs in AD pathogenesis, which could serve as potential therapeutic targets as well as diagnostic markers.",
        "conclusion": "Unlike traditional drugs, miRNAs work at a molecular level and control target protein expression by directly binding to sequences in the mRNA of relevant signaling pathways. However, for miRNAs to function at high doses, they must be systematically delivered to the CNS, and crossing the BBB is challenging. Although local brain drug delivery is challenging to achieve using current treatments, it has considerable effects on animal therapy research. Local drug delivery is anticipated to be utilized in the future to distribute miRNAs to the brain to treat AD, provided that clinical drug delivery technologies continue to advance . Advances in pharmaceutics are required to improve the potency and efficiency of drugs, optimize their properties, and ensure their safety. Advances in the chemical and material sciences have enhanced the administration, delivery, and modification of medications. To some extent, when creating miRNA mimics and anti-miRNAs, one may consult guidelines for creating medications based on siRNAs and ASO, respectively. Preclinical research requires the use of preconditioned animal models. Furthermore, to determine the best method to administer a drug and assess its toxicity in the human body, thorough clinical trials are required. Though some clinical trials have been carried out, no outcomes have been obtained as of yet. This could be because of small sample sizes, the intrusive character of the testing procedures, and the general public’s difficulty accepting and analyzing the results. To confirm that miRNAs are biomarkers for identifying neurodegenerative illnesses, a few clinical trials are now being prepared for enrollment and investigation . The delivery processes, including BBB permeability, particle instability, low trafficking to the target sites, biodistribution within tissues, and improper cargo release from delivery vehicles, represent the largest obstacles to the development of effective miR-based therapies. The development of efficient nanocarriers for the delivery of miRNAs may be aided by the development of nanomedicines. Furthermore, to provide accurate physicochemical characterization and assessment of the in vivo activity of a drug, batch-to-batch variability must be eliminated during the development of drug systems by carefully adjusting the nanoparticle composition and miRNA loading . Therefore, to provide a unified approach for the manufacturing and assessment of medications, suitable regulatory concerns and quality control techniques are required. From a biological perspective, there is growing evidence that miRNAs are crucial for regulating many biological processes, such as the formation and normal operation of the central nervous system, and miRNAs are shown to reflect the degenerative process taking place in the brain tissue and are differentially expressed in patients compared to controls . The analysis of miRNAs as a potent diagnostic biomarker faces numerous pre-analytical and analytical obstacles. However, standardizing methods and analyses is necessary to bring them into clinical practice and ensure low costs as well as high specificity and sensitivity. Another challenge is finding certain miRNA patterns that can discriminate between different conditions such as separating AD patients from healthy people, determining the disease’s severity, and separating AD patients from those with neurological disorders. However, when a sufficiently large panel of miRNAs is analyzed, distinct patterns of miRNAs may still be found concerning certain disorders, even despite these overlaps. This may improve the utility and specificity of miRNAs as biomarkers. The absence of reference level, analytical standardization, and clinical validation remain significant issues with miRNAs as a biomarker. Biofluid-derived indicators are currently being investigated as potential biomarkers for the early and preclinical diagnosis of indicators of AD. Many miRNAs that regulate AD-associated proteins in the brain have been reported to be dysregulated. These molecules target gene networks in the brain that play crucial roles in synapse formation and physiology. Therefore, miRs may be promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD, and measuring miRNA levels in peripheral blood may help distinguish between individuals with late-stage AD and those whose levels change in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, miRNAs may be used as potential biomarkers for the early prognosis of AD."

It is progressive and targets about 10% of the United States population over the age of 65.3 to date, there is no cure to the disease. Physicians can treat symptoms but lack the ability to stop the progression of the disease. However, promising research has come to the surface in recent years. A collection of these therapeutic targets, which have yielded positive results in mice models, are presented in this article. They include targets such as meningeal lymphatics, mitochondrial homeostasis, genomic instability, calcium homeostasis, and cold-shock proteins such as RNA-binding motif protein 3 and reticulon-3, high-density lipoprotein, and antibodies.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease with no known cure. It affects almost 6 million people in just the United States and continuously deteriorates their quality of life. The current treatments for AD are centered on slowing disease progression rather than curing the illness. AD is caused by the buildup of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques that disrupt neurochemical signaling. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved to form these (Aβ) plaques. This disruption causes atrophy and ventriculomegaly leading to a myriad of issues including cognitive decline and onset of behavior and psychological ailments. Acetylcholine is overall decreased while there is N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) overactivity, so those are the main current therapeutic targets. The most common symptoms are memory loss and confusion, which are usually treated by NDMA antagonists such as memantine or central acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine. These work to increase the amount of neurotransmitter signaling in the declining regions in the brain. This treatment may cause the working neurons to fire more often but will not stop the number of neurons from continuously diminishing. There have been many new theoretical solutions to treat AD instead of targeting only its symptoms or progression. This article looks at a collection of prospective therapeutic targets of AD and provides a comprehensive look on the findings of each.",
        "conclusion": "There are many promising prospective AD treatments in the process of being studied. These treatments aim to stop the progression of the disease and try to conserve the synapses between neurons and emphasizing neuroprotective functions. The main treatments discussed in this article are meningeal lymphatics, mitochondrial homeostasis, histone deacetylases, calcium homeostasis, RBM3 and RTN3, HDL, and donanemab [Table 1]. These targets have all been shown to play a role in the development of AD through the use of mice models. They should be explored further as they have the potential to provide new avenues for new neuroprotective therapies."

        "title": "Future Therapeutic Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease: Focus on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, degenerative brain disorder that impairs memory and thinking skills, leading to significant economic and humanistic burdens. It is associated with various neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as anxiety, agitation, depression, aggression, apathy, and psychosis. NPSs are common in patients with AD, affecting up to 97% of individuals diagnosed with AD. The severity of NPS is linked to disease progression and cognitive decline. NPS in Alzheimer's disease leads to increased morbidity, mortality, caregiver burden, earlier nursing home placement, and higher healthcare costs. Despite their significant impact, clinical research on NPS in AD is limited. In clinical settings, accurately distinguishing and diagnosing NPS related to AD remains a challenge. Additionally, conventional treatments for NPS in AD are often ineffective, highlighting the need for new therapies that target these specific symptoms. Understanding these comorbidities can aid in early diagnosis and better management of AD. In this review, we provide a summary of the various neurological and psychiatric symptoms (NPS) associated with AD and new candidates under development for the treatment of NPS based on their therapeutic targets and mechanisms. On top of the conventional NPS studied so far, this review adds recent advancements in the understanding of social functional impairment in AD. This review also provides information that can contribute to the advancement of studies and translational research in this field by emphasizing therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action focused on AD-related NPS rather than conventional mechanisms targeted in AD drug development. Above all, considering the relative lack of research in this new field despite the importance of clinical, medical, and translational research, it may increase interest in NPS in AD, its pathophysiological mechanisms, and potential therapeutic candidates such as molecules with antioxidant potential.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects cognitive function, primarily memory and thinking skills. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60–80% of cases. AD imposes a substantial economic burden on society, encompassing direct (such as medical and non-medical expenses) and indirect costs (related to informal caregiving, lost productivity, and intangible costs). The total societal burden of AD exceeds USD 958 billion worldwide and is projected to increase significantly by 2050 . Beyond its economic impact, AD also imposes a huge humanistic burden on individuals affected by it, their caregivers, and society. This burden encompasses emotional, psychological, and social challenges such as reduced quality of life, loss of independence, changes in relationships, caregiver stress and burnout, stigma, and overall decline in well-being. AD has predominantly been researched with a focus on cognitive function and memory decline in terms of diagnosis, management, and treatment development. However, over the decades, patients, families, and healthcare providers have recognized that various behavioral, neurological, psychological, and psychiatric symptoms can accompany AD, both before and after its onset. These symptoms include depression, apathy, anxiety, agitation, aggression, personality changes, sleep disturbances, fatigue, psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia), sensory impairment, and motor dysfunction. Collectively, these symptoms, which will be defined as neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in this article, are observed in approximately one-third of individuals with dementia residing in the community and up to 80% of those in long-term care facilities supervised by nursing staff . Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are fundamental features of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, with nearly all individuals diagnosed with AD developing NPS during the disease progression. The prevalence of NPS in AD can vary depending on factors such as disease stage, age of onset, and genetic predispositions. While NPS typically becomes more pronounced in the later stage of AD, population-based studies have shown that these symptoms often manifest in the very early stages, including the prodromal stage, such as MCI . Among NPS, depression and apathy are the most frequently observed in patients with MCI and early AD, often accompanied by verbal and physical agitation. As AD advances, symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and aggression become more common, while apathy remains the most persistent and prevalent NPS across all stages of the disease. In addition, disruptions in circadian sleep–wake cycles become more pronounced in patients with AD compared to normal aging processes. Notably, patients with MCI who experience depression are at a significantly higher risk of progressing to AD. Conversely, individuals with mild behavioral impairment are more likely to develop dementia, even if their cognitive function is within normal range. Symptoms like agitation, apathy, anxiety, disinhibition, euphoria, and irritability may have stronger associations with the onset of MCI than depression. Therefore, further research is needed to investigate the difference in prevalence associated with these factors. Analysis of comorbidities in patients with AD has revealed a combination of neurological, psychiatric, and peripheral disorders with significant involvement of reactive oxygen species and the anti-oxidative system, inflammation, obesity, and hypertension as determining factors , and the trajectory of comorbidity could be different from that of the aging population without AD symptoms . A study based on a Spanish cohort over 6 years period reported a wide range of comorbidities in patients with AD. Approximately 55.1% of patients had 9–12 comorbidities, followed by 32.8% of patients with 5–8 comorbidities . The most common comorbidities include hypertension, neurotic disorders, personality disorders, and other nonpsychotic disorders, as well as metabolic disorders and immune disorders . The occurrence of various comorbidities, especially neuropsychiatric comorbidities, in AD varies depending on disease onset, stage, and pathological state. Sometimes, the presence of a neuropsychiatric condition obscures the detection of AD and vice versa. Therefore, identifying these neurological comorbidities and understanding their characteristics can aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Additionally, the occurrence of these co-symptoms can be influenced by various factors, such as age at disease onset, level of education, and gender. Utilizing this information can help to develop personalized treatment approaches . Furthermore, neurological comorbidities associated with AD are often not well controlled by conventional antidepressants and antipsychotics that are typically used for patients with individual disorders . This highlights the urgent need for the development of new therapies that can specifically modulate NPS, indicating the presence of disease-specific mechanisms underlying NPS in AD . The new treatment approach may encompass several unconventional and innovative approaches, such as genetic considerations related to AD manifestation and pathophysiology, nonpharmacologic approaches such as psychosocial paradigms, and exploration of alternative therapeutic targets such as 5-HT2A receptor antagonists/inverse agonists and 5-HT6 receptor antagonists for AD-related psychosis . In this review, we aimed to provide a brief summary of the various neurological and psychiatric symptoms associated with AD, followed by a description of candidate compounds for clinical trials aimed at modulating these symptoms and their mechanisms of action. Specifically, we seek to offer information that can contribute to the advancement of research and translational studies in this field by highlighting therapeutic targets and mechanisms focusing on improving AD-related neurological and psychiatric symptoms rather than conventional mechanisms targeted in drug development. Additional attention should also be paid to social interaction deficits in AD and its pathophysiological mechanism, along with potential therapeutic candidates considering the relative scarcity of research in this emerging field, albeit of clinical, medical, and translational importance (Figure 1).",
        "conclusion": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) frequently co-occur with other symptoms, often overlapping into different symptom clusters, which complicates the identification of distinct syndromes. Clarifying these syndromes is essential, as understanding the phenotype of NPS can lead to the identification of specific brain regions and neural circuits involved, offering insights into their neuropathogenesis. It remains unclear whether the prevalence of certain NPS is influenced more by genetic factors, medical comorbidities, lifestyle patterns, neurotransmitter system involvement, or brain atrophy and disconnection, such as in the prefrontal cortex. Further translational research based on these neurobiological changes will facilitate the development of more targeted drug treatments and non-pharmacological management techniques, thereby improving both patient outcomes and caregivers’ well-being. This review provides several key takeaways for clinicians and patients that can improve the diagnosis, management, and treatment of NPS in AD. First, it suggests the importance of early diagnosis and screening of NPS in individuals at high risk of AD or showing MCI. NPS like depression, anxiety, and apathy often precede cognitive decline in AD. Clinicians should integrate routine screening tools for NPS in at-risk individuals, enabling earlier interventions that may help slow disease progression. Second, this review urges the appreciation of the limitations of current treatments. Conventional therapies, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, often fail to effectively treat NPS in AD. Newer drugs like dextromethorphan/quinidine and brexpiprazole offer alternative options that target broader neurochemical pathways. Clinicians should consider these options, especially when traditional medications are ineffective. Continued interest and vigilance in this field of medicine is crucial. Third, this review provides the value of non-pharmacological approaches to treating NPS in AD. Behavioral interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and social support programs, can be valuable, especially for managing sleep disturbances, anxiety, and social deficits. Training caregivers in behavioral strategies such as recognizing early signs of agitation or aggression and using de-escalation techniques can alleviate both caregiver burden and patient distress. Integrating these approaches into care plans can reduce reliance on medication and improve quality of life. Fourth, the importance of social engagement in AD management is emphasized. Social isolation can accelerate disease progression, while increased social interaction, through structured activities or caregiver-supported engagement, can improve both cognitive and emotional outcomes. Clinicians should encourage maintaining or enhancing social interactions and explore interventions, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to enhance social functioning in patients with AD. Lastly, the review highlights the ongoing exploration of emerging therapies. New treatments, including psilocybin, pimavanserin, and AVP-786, are being investigated in clinical trials, with the potential for future expansion. These developments may offer new options for patients and their caregivers, fostering informed decision-making. In summary, clinicians can use these insights to better identify and treat NPS in AD, exploring newer pharmacological treatments, prioritizing non-pharmacological strategies, and focusing on social engagement to improve patient outcomes. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), along with cognitive decline, is a major type of dementia, showing high prevalence rates worldwide due to the aging population and societal progress, with patients increasing over time. Numerous studies have been conducted to diagnose and treat AD, focusing on target discovery and drug development. Not only global big pharma but also startup venture companies worldwide are actively developing pipelines for AD. Currently, AD treatment pipelines are being developed based on disease-modifying drugs, cognitive-enhancing drugs, and neuropsychiatric symptom treatment. Traditionally, AD therapeutic development has focused on pathology-based targets, aiming to address cognitive impairment and prevent neuronal cell death. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine are currently used for cognitive impairment in AD. Recently, the US FDA approved AD therapies targeting amyloid beta clearance, including aducanumab in 2021, lecanemab in 2023, and donanemab in 2024. Additionally, clinical trials are underway for tau pathology and neuronal cell death inhibition. Beyond cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation, aggression, apathy, psychosis, sleep disturbances, and social deficits significantly impact patients with AD and caregivers. In this review, the pipelines for NPS treatment were discussed, focusing on drugs targeting neurotransmitter receptors such as NMDA receptors, cannabinoids, sigma receptors, and adrenergic receptors. These drugs include cannabidiol, THC-free CBD, masupirdine, dronabidol, hallucinogens like psilocybin, and antioxidant molecules such as DHA, which are currently undergoing clinical trials. In particular, symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, aggression, and social deficits observed in patients with AD are similar to those seen in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). As a result, drugs that were previously tested as ASD treatments are now being investigated in clinical trials as potential NPS therapies for AD. This potential trend extends from ASD, which exhibits social processing dysfunction based on the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), to other neurological disorders such as depression and Parkinson’s disease. Successful NPS treatment of AD is not only applicable for the sophisticated management of AD but may also have potential applications and help mechanistic understanding of other neurological disorders, such as depression, bipolar disorders, anxiety, schizophrenia, ASD, and Parkinson’s disease."

Currently, the FDA has approved few drugs for AD, which aim to improve quality of life but do not change or slow disease progression (2). At this time the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD are not fully understood, and current therapeutic interventions are limited in efficacy. The pathological hallmark of the disease is the deposition of beta-amyloid (β-amyloid) plaques and the resulting formation of neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (3). Due to the location of these pathological markers within neurons, neurons have been the target of research. Ramon y Cajal eloquently demonstrated these pathological hallmarks decades earlier (4). Interestingly, Ramon y Cajal also noted reactive hypertrophic astrocytes that surrounded senile plaques and blood vessels with amyloid deposits in post-mortem AD patients (4). Thus, astrocytic changes due to neurodegeneration are not a new discovery. However, there has been minimal advancement in understanding the role of astrocytes in the development of AD. This lack of progress was likely due to insufficient technology and methods. Due to new innovative technologies, there is an increasing focus on elucidating the physiological changes within astrocytes during AD progression. The astrocyte is a prevalent cell type within the central nervous system (CNS). They have diverse and vital functions within the CNS including contributions to synaptogenesis, ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter buffering, the blood brain barrier (BBB), and inter/intracellular communication (5). Furthermore, astrocytes are a heterogeneous group of cells with diverse phenotypes and functions specific to their origin regionally (5, 6). Currently, significant effort has been dedicated to investigating the distinct functions of astrocytes as it relates to neurodegenerative disease (5, 7). This review will examine the current understanding of the roles of reactive astrocytes and potential astrocytic biomarkers unique to AD. We will further explore new technologies such as single-cell sequencing and its potential effectiveness in deciphering the phenotypic changes astrocytes undergo in the context of AD. Finally, we will examine how these technologies can help to dissect astrocyte states or subtypes during AD progression.",
        "conclusion": "In summary, there is overwhelming evidence of the vital role astrocytes play in the pathophysiological development and progression of AD. The advent of technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and single-molecule imaging provides a greater understanding of the temporal and spatial progression of astrocytes that occurs during AD, which could serve as a framework for researchers to elucidate specific astrocytic biomarkers involved in AD progression (120). Specifically, studies using transcriptomics have allowed us to understand further that reactive astrocytes develop different molecular states during the progression of AD (37). As mentioned earlier, scRNAseq in AD models has demonstrated multiple stage-dependent conditions or subpopulations of reactive astrocytes (114–116). These studies signify the importance of characterizing the complex diversity and function of reactive astrocytes in each individual state to understand further the unique role these changes have in AD progression (114, 115). Therefore, it is not as simple to classify reactive astrocytes in AD as protective or toxic. Understanding the molecular changes at a single-cell level could also provide insight on the time point in which therapeutic intervention against reactive astrocytes can be applied, to harness AD progression and symptoms. The combination of powerful technologies such as viral gene transfer, electrophysiology, and optogenetics with transcriptomics can further elucidate the functions of reactive astrocytes in AD (37, 121). Additionally, the roles and mechanisms of regulatory RNAs, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are underexplored in AD (122, 123). Currently, studies have demonstrated the regulatory role of lncRNA as it relates to tau hyperphosphorylation and others have suggested the utility of lncRNA as a biomarker for AD (124). These studies have provided the exciting potential of lncRNA as both diagnostic and therapeutic targets for AD. Another critical consideration in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD and determining fruitful therapeutic targets is ensuring we select appropriate in vitro and in vivo study models. Most cellular spatial information regarding cellular relationships to β-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles is lost when isolating mRNA samples (125). Similarly, morphological and transcriptomic comparisons on human and mouse reactive astrocytes have revealed significant differences (37). This exemplifies the inherent limitations of in vitro studies and animal models in AD, and the difficulty in interpreting results when comparing studies with post-mortem specimens. Human induced pluripotent stem cells are currently increasingly employed in basic science research and can help narrow these differences (37). Furthermore, using multiple genomic techniques in combination, such as spatial transcriptomics and in situ sequencing, provides a benefit in preserving cellular spatial information (125). In conclusion, a consensus regarding appropriate research models and the integration of multiple “omic” modalities could provide improved diagnostic and therapeutic targets in reactive astrocytes."

        "title": "Epigenetic Regulation of Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease and clinically manifests with cognitive decline and behavioral disabilities. Over the past years, mounting studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response plays a key role in the onset and development of AD, and neuroinflammation has been proposed as the third major pathological driving factor of AD, ranking after the two well-known core pathologies, amyloid β (Aβ) deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Epigenetic mechanisms, referring to heritable changes in gene expression independent of DNA sequence alterations, are crucial regulators of neuroinflammation which have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for AD. Upon regulation of transcriptional repression or activation, epigenetic modification profiles are closely involved in inflammatory gene expression and signaling pathways of neuronal differentiation and cognitive function in central nervous system disorders. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about epigenetic control mechanisms with a focus on DNA and histone modifications involved in the regulation of inflammatory genes and signaling pathways in AD, and the inhibitors under clinical assessment are also discussed.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease, with most commonly presented symptoms including cognitive impairment, memory loss, spatial dysfunction, psychiatric disorder, etc. AD typically occurs in people over the age of 65 and also shows an alarming increasing occurrence largely due to the aging population. AD is a pathologically multifactorial disease, and many factors are proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of AD such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) induced by tau protein hyperphosphorylation, in association with synapse loss, neuronal cell death, chronic neuroinflammation, etc., . Although amyloid cascade has long been regarded as the most prevalent hypothesis, accumulating evidence suggests that this hypothesis is insufficient in explaining many aspects of AD pathogenesis and by far there remains no effective treatment for AD pathology based on this hypothesis . Since a number of evidence has accumulated showing that AD risk factors are more closely associated with inflammation response, the inflammation hypothesis has lately gained increased support as an early detrimental event related to the onset and clinical progress of AD . In the early stages of AD, glial cell-mediated immune response in AD is involved in the clearance of Aβ, but with the progression of the disease, the excessive inflammatory response in turn aggravates the pathological process of AD. Neuroinflammation in the brain has already been proposed to be an additional core pathological change through the whole pathological course . Inflammation is a defensive pathological response of body tissues to the external stimulus such as pathogens, damaged cells, irritants, or endogenous signals and forms an important part of non-specific immunity . Acute inflammation is an early and immediate response to injury or damage with the main purpose of interference or tissue repair, while chronic inflammation ensues if injurious factors persist to cause slow and long-term inflammatory reactions . In chronic inflammation, there are a variety of inflammatory cell infiltrations and cytokine secretion, and the resultant damage is closely related to multiple human chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and CNS disorders. Neuroinflammation is an innate and complex immune response mediated by microglia and astrocytes in the CNS . In the occurrence of brain inflammation, acute inflammation plays a defensive role against nervous injury, infection, and other stimuli, characterized by the activation of immune cells, infiltration of peripheral inflammatory cells, and release of various inflammatory factors . But when the equilibrium between anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory signaling is disrupted, as seen in AD, chronic inflammation occurs, which is attributed to activated microglia and the release of diverse cytokines . Sustained inflammation in the brain is considered to be related not only to neurodegeneration but also exacerbates both Aβ and tau protein pathology, indicating inflammation as a fundamental trigger for AD pathogenesis . Despite extensive investigation of inflammatory mechanisms, the inflammation transition between protective and pathological roles remains unclear. In recent years, epigenetic modification has emerged as a fundamental mediator in many human diseases such as CNS disorder . Epigenetic modification refers to heritable changes in gene expression independent of DNA sequence alteration and mainly includes DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding RNAs, chromatin remodeling, nucleosome positioning, etc., . To date, a growing body of studies has confirmed that the epigenetic mechanism is widely involved in biological processes such as embryonic development, stem cell regulation, cell apoptosis, and organ homeostasis maintenance and is closely related to the occurrence and progression of various human diseases . Upon regulation of transcriptional repression or activation, epigenetic modifiers are considered regulators of complex mechanisms underlying inflammatory signaling in neuronal differentiation and plasticity, as well as cognition functions in CNS diseases . A percentage of studies have suggested that epigenetic alteration in brain regions and peripheral lymphocytes could cause inflammatory responses, microglia hyperactivation, and CNS inflammation amplification, resulting in the pathological development of AD (Figure 1) . Understanding the epigenetic mechanisms in inflammatory response will provide additional valuable insights for AD pathophysiological processes. The current review focuses on the epigenetic regulation of neuroinflammation in AD pathology, with an emphasis on DNA and histone modifications.",
        "conclusion": "AD is a multifaceted disease caused by the joint action of genetic and environmental factors, and the signal hypothesis of linear causality based on Aβ and tau can not fully address the pathogenesis of AD. Currently, there is a paucity of effective therapeutic options for AD, while the present clinical treatment merely provides limited symptomatic relief. Growing evidence has shown that neuroinflammation plays an essential role in driving the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and thus has received great attention as a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment. A wide array of findings has revealed that the molecular alternations in inflammatory signaling are governed by epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic mechanisms are tightly involved in gene expression and molecular signaling pathways, thereby participating in the coordination and adaptation of the body to external environmental changes and body aging, as well as in the occurrence and development of various diseases. Epigenetic modifications have an important role in AD pathology and cognitive function through the involvement of APP metabolism, Aβ formation, tau protein phosphorylation, oxidative stress response, cell apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. Early diagnosis and intervention can help prevent and treat AD; however, there has been a lack of effective detection indexes so far. Changes in inflammation-related epigenetic regulations are capable of providing effective indication for AD diagnosis. Dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms such as histone methylation and acetylation are closely associated with inflammation-induced learning and memory deficiencies. However, understanding of the exact molecular regulatory mechanism still remains limited. Additionally, due to the lack of specificity of gene regulation, many epigenetic interventions may affect other molecular mechanisms and signaling transduction. Additionally, epigenetic modulators usually regulate gene expression and the inflammatory signaling cascade, mainly in the form of protein complexes that may be affected by different intervention approaches . For instance, specific genetic depletion of target modulators may elicit dissociation of the protein complex and thereby release the cofactors to activate multiple signaling cascades, resulting in unexpected phenotypes. In contrast, pharmacological intervention with small molecules mainly interferes with the catalytic activity of the target protein without affecting its expression, but the outcomes are highly dependent on the targeting specificity of small molecules. Although the role of epigenetic regulations in inflammation regarding neurodegenerative diseases has been extensively explored, there currently remains a paucity of reliable biological indicators for AD diagnosis and treatment. Further studies to insightfully elucidate the interplay between the epigenetic control and neuroinflammation may help to determine the therapeutically beneficial markers and provide additional treatment strategies for patients with AD. In addition, the selectivity of current HDAC inhibitors remains limited as their effects on the different subtypes of HDACs implicated in AD development are not fully elucidated. To advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms related to the impairment of memory and learning in AD, it is imperative to determine the specific subtypes of HDAC family members associated with the disease’s pathology."

        "title": "The Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome in Alzheimer's Disease and Potential Therapeutic Targets.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment. The typical pathological characteristics of AD are extracellular senile plaques composed of amyloid ß (Aβ) protein, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed by the hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau, and neuron loss. In the past hundred years, although human beings have invested a lot of manpower, material and financial resources, there is no widely recognized drug for the effective prevention and clinical cure of AD in the world so far. Therefore, evaluating and exploring new drug targets for AD treatment is an important topic. At present, researchers have not stopped exploring the pathogenesis of AD, and the views on the pathogenic factors of AD are constantly changing. Multiple evidence have confirmed that chronic neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. In the field of neuroinflammation, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a key molecular link in the AD neuroinflammatory pathway. Under the stimulation of Aβ oligomers and tau aggregates, it can lead to the assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia and astrocytes in the brain, thereby causing caspase-1 activation and the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, which ultimately triggers the pathophysiological changes and cognitive decline of AD. In this review, we summarize current literatures on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and activation-related regulation mechanisms, and discuss its possible roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Moreover, focusing on the NLRP3 inflammasome and combining with the upstream and downstream signaling pathway-related molecules of NLRP3 inflammasome as targets, we review the pharmacologically related targets and various methods to alleviate neuroinflammation by regulating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, which provides new ideas for the treatment of AD.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that occurs in the elderly, and is also called senile dementia. The main clinical manifestations of AD patients are the progressive decline of self-care ability, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities, which seriously affects the quality of life of AD patients. The typical pathological features of AD are senile plaques related to extracellular amyloid ß (Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylation of intracellular microtubule-associated tau (d'Errico and Meyer-Luehmann 2020). With the aging of the global society becoming more and more prominent, the increasing number of AD patients has become a major public health problem, which has brought a heavy burden to individuals, the society and families. AD is first described by the German physician Alois Alzheimer in 1906 and has a history of more than one hundred years (Sanabria-Castro et al., 2017). The pathogenesis of AD is complex and diverse, which mainly involves genetic and environmental factors (Dunn et al., 2019), Aβ toxicity (Benilova et al., 2012), tau hyperphosphorylation (Wang et al., 2014), central nervous system (CNS) inflammation (Kinney et al., 2018), synaptic dysfunction (Li et al., 2018a), cholinergic deficiency (Frost et al., 2017), oxidative stress (Islam et al., 2019), mitochondrial dysfunction (Cardoso et al., 2004), autophagy and mitophagy abnormalities (Reddy and Oliver 2019), lipid metabolism disorder (Zhu et al., 2019), imbalance of calcium homeostasis (Popugaeva et al., 2015), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Huang et al., 2015), etc. Although the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the Tau protein theory are currently accepted by most investigators, the continuous and excessive neuroinflammatory response also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is crucial in the neuroinflammatory pathway and has recently been highlighted as a potential target for AD treatment. Inflammasome is a type of cytosolic multiprotein complex and plays a crucial role in innate immunity. The concept of inflammasome is first proposed by Tschopp and his colleagues in 2002. It is mainly composed of three parts: intracytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the adaptor protein domain and the effector domain cysteine protease pro-caspase-1 (Martinon et al., 2002). In the CNS, the inflammasome mainly presents in the cytoplasm of immune cells, neuronal cells, microglia and astrocytes (Minkiewicz et al., 2013; von et al., 2018; Hanslik and Ulland 2020), and can recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or host-derived danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Among the many reported inflammasomes, the NLRP3 inflammasome is currently the most studied one. Just like the structure of the above-mentioned inflammasomes, the NLRP3 inflammasome includes the sensor protein NLRP3, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (caspase activation and recruitment domain) (ASC), and the effector protein (pro-caspase-1, a cysteine protease) (Schroder and Tschopp 2010). These three proteins can interact closely to regulate the function of NLRP3 inflammasome. Once NLRP3 recognizes the foreign pathogen molecules or internal danger signals, it will be activated and undergos self-oligomerization. Then NLRP3 binds to the pyrin domain (PYD) domain of the adaptor protein ASC, and recruits the protease pro-caspase-1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome, which cleaves pro-caspase-1 into activated caspase-1 through autocatalysis. The activated caspase-1, as an inflammasome effector protein, is able to cleave the inactive pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into mature forms of IL-1β and IL-18, respectively. Ultimately, IL-1β and IL-18 are released outside of the cell to play a variety of non-specific inflammatory roles (Martinon et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2019). In addition, the activated caspase-1 can also mediate a type of inflammatory-related programmed cell death, which is called pyroptosis. A large amount of inflammatory substances released after cell pyroptosis will induce a strong inflammatory response (Fink and Cookson 2006; Shi et al., 2015). More and more experimental evidence show that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases (Duan et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021). Under the stimulation of Aβ plaques and tau aggregates, microglia and astrocytes mediate chronic neuroinflammatory response, neuronal death and pyroptosis through intracellular NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby driving the occurrence and progression of AD (Han et al., 2020b; Van Zeller et al., 2021). More importantly, pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome exhibits neuroprotective effects. The use of inhibitory treatment against NLRP3 inflammasome can reduce Aβ deposition and alleviate the cognitive impairment of AD mice (Yan et al., 2020b). In this review, we mainly summarize the mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and analyze its possible roles in the progression of AD. In addition, we also introduce the upstream and downstream signaling pathways of the NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as the latest developments regarding its potential targets and therapeutic strategies for AD treatment.",
        "conclusion": "It has been nearly 2 decades since the NLRP3 inflammasome being discovered. With continuous studies, researchers have gained a certain understanding of the structure, composition, regulation and role of NLRP3, but its precise molecular mechanisms in diseases have not been fully elucidated. In recent years, the research of NLRP3 inflammasome in neurodegenerative diseases has attracted much attention. More and more evidences have confirmed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. More importantly, microglia and astrocytes play a crucial role in the chronic neuroinflammatory response of AD caused by NLRP3 inflammasome. In AD cells and animal models, the inhibitory measures against NLRP3 or its inflammasome constituent molecules can alleviate the inflammatory response, and reduce Aβ deposition, Tau phosphorylation and other pathological features, thereby improving AD-related behavioral abnormalities. Therefore, targeting NLRP3 inflammasome may be a new trend for AD treatment. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome involves upstream signal related regulatory factors, priming signal, activation signal and downstream IL-1β and IL-18 effectors. In the early stage of drug development, researchers usually focus on strategies to block downstream inflammatory cytokines. Inhibitors targeting IL-1β as drugs for the treatment of neurological diseases have not achieved satisfactory clinical results. With the discovery of new drug targets, people gradually turn their attentions to NLRP3 and the constituent molecules ASC and caspase-1. This targeting effect is selective and efficient, which can ensure the specificity of the treatment to the greatest extent and reduce non-specific effects. In addition, the upstream-related regulatory factors of NLRP3 inflammasome activation can also become attractive pharmacological targets, but due to the complexity of the interaction of upstream signals, it may bring non-specific therapeutic roles. So far, although many compounds have successfully been identified to target NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro and in vivo, their therapeutic effects and safety in AD patients have yet to be verified by clinical trials. In the CNS diseases, the development of therapeutic drugs targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome needs to be evaluated by its permeability across the BBB. More importantly, under the premise of obtaining the desired therapeutic values, it will not cause toxic effects on the whole-body or CNS. In addition, AD is a long-term chronic progressive disease, and usually requires intervention in the early stage of the disease. However, whether long-term use of targeted drugs for inflammasomes will affect the health of AD patients requires further evaluation. In view of the good safety and side effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicines and plant-derived compounds, they may provide new directions for the treatment of AD."

        "abstract": "Alexander's disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by upregulation of the GFAP gene and the formation of Rosenthal fibers. Its prognosis is fatal, with limited treatment options currently available. The GFAP protein is a marker for mature astrocytes. It results in the upregulation of reactive astroglioses. Reactive astroglioses is a neuroprotective condition that, when functioning correctly, helps protect the brain from stress and injury and prevents further injury. However, unregulated reactive astroglioses is linked with many neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the relative rarity in the incidence of AxD, treatment options have not been as widely investigated. This review explores potential drug targets that may impact GFAP gene expression, such as STAT3, GDNF, NF-kB, LCN-2, and the LPS pathway. These drug targets have previously been or are currently being explored in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The only treatment option currently in clinical trial phases involves methods to induce the knockout of the GFAP gene. Due to GFAP's neuroprotective role in brain injury and stress, it is important to explore alternative treatment options that downregulate GFAP as opposed to shutting it off entirely.",
        "year": "2025",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40448810/",
        "introduction": "Alexander disease (AxD) is a neurological disorder mainly caused by unique, somatic mutations in the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) . Rarely inherited, deleterious mutations, or mutations that reduce reproductive fitness and result in premature death, also cause AxD . This condition is marked by the upregulation of the GFAP gene, which has many structural and physiological impacts, such as disruption of the filament assembly network in astrocytes and Rosenthal fiber formation in astrocytes . Although precise mutations in the GFAP gene are variable, all known cases present with an upregulation of the GFAP protein itself. The pathogenesis of non-heritable AxD is unknown, particularly in the case of infantile AxD. However, some studies suggest that environmental factors may contribute to the disorder in adults, such as brain trauma/injury, alcohol exposure, and infection . In adult-onset AxD, current evidence suggests head trauma and injury may be the leading cause of disease onset . Potentially, infantile and juvenile onset believed to be caused by somatic mutations may be caused by heritable mutations in not yet symptomatic parental genomes, as there has been an observed latency period between trauma and disease onset of up to 10 years in adult cases through epigenetic gene alterations . Adult-onset cases may also have mild symptoms that result in a missed or incorrect diagnosis . AxD is separated into two distinct subtypes based on the onset of the disease: type 1 and type 2. Forebrain lesions and early, infantile onset are typical of type 1 AxD, whereas type 2 is characterized by hindbrain lesions with a variable age of onset . Symptoms are variable and depend on age of onset and individual manifestations, but may include macrocephaly, failure to reach milestones, abnormal motor function, and and speech difficulties . The age of onset and severity of symptoms are believed to be factors in the progression speed of the disease. Still, what other factors may play a role is unclear, as severity and age alone are insufficient in determining the rate of disease progression . AxD is commonly diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows abnormalities in brain white matter . Treatment methods have been tested on mouse models, but no standard treatment is available for humans. Recently, GFAP knockout has been explored as an option for treating AxD, a method that is based on the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) . GFAP knockouts have been shown to prevent disease in rat models and reverse existing pathologies associated with AxD, such as improving myelin degradation . However, this strategy has not reached beyond clinical trials. Although it is a rare disease, it is vital to find new and more efficient treatment methods for those inflicted with AxD. Finding an effective target for treatment may also have further clinical implications. This is because numerous other neurodegenerative disorders show the hallmark upregulation of the GFAP gene observed in AxD, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's, as well as in some cases of non-specific dementia . Finding a treatment for AxD that potentially lowers GFAP expression to normal levels may prove helpful in treating other diseases and reducing their respective symptoms. The purpose of this review is to explore potential drug target options. A summary of the causes of the AxD pathology is provided below in Fig. 1.Fig. 1A summary of AxD pathology; connection between observed impact and their corresponding clinical presentation. A mutation occurs in variable locations on the GFAP protein, resulting in the following direct and observed results: altered intermediate filament assembly, Rosenthal fiber formation, and upregulation of GFAP and its respective regulatory genes. As a result, astrocyte function and myelin formation are disturbed, and reactive astrogliosis is upregulated. This results in white matter degeneration and brain tissue damage. These account for the symptoms observed in individuals with AxD, such as coordination problems and developmental delays. All these outcomes compound to further contribute to neurodegeneration, which in turn further exacerbates these issues",
        "conclusion": "AxD is a neurodegenerative disorder whose mechanisms and symptoms are not clearly understood. Perhaps because of the vagueness surrounding its mechanism and symptoms—and its relatively low prevalence—treatment options are limited. Besides symptomatic treatment, all current treatment options focus entirely on downregulating the GFAP gene. However, GFAP’s role in injury may mean inhibition increases vulnerability to brain injury and has a less effective healing response in associated brain tissues. Therefore, exploring other treatment options is vital. GDNF, NF-kB, Lipocalin, and STAT3 are suggested due to their role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, as well as the fact that they have all been previously studied in other neurodegenerative diseases."

        "abstract": "The multifactorial and complex nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has made it difficult to identify therapeutic targets that are causally involved in the disease process. However, accumulating evidence from experimental and clinical studies that investigate the early disease process point towards the required role of tau in AD etiology. Importantly, a large number of studies investigate and characterize the plethora of pathological forms of tau protein involved in disease onset and propagation. Immunotherapy is one of the most clinical approaches anticipated to make a difference in the field of AD therapeutics. Tau -targeted immunotherapy is the new direction after the failure of amyloid beta (Aß)-targeted immunotherapy and the growing number of studies that highlight the Aß-independent disease process. It is now well established that immunotherapy alone will most likely be insufficient as a monotherapy. Therefore, this review discusses updates on tau-targeted immunotherapy studies, AD-relevant tau species, updates on promising biomarkers and a prospect on combination therapies to surround the disease propagation in an efficient and timely manner.",
        "year": "2020",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31841678/",
        "introduction": "Despite all the failed immunotherapy clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyloid beta (Aß) and tau targeted immunotherapies are still at the forefront of therapeutic approaches (Hoskin et al., 2019; Cummings et al., 2019). Besides being the identifying hallmarks of the disease, Aß and tau aggregates have been extensively studied and directly linked to neurodegeneration. Aß and tau, primarily the oligomeric species of each, have been shown to be neurotoxic both extracellularly and intracellularly (Frost et al., 2009; Sebastián-Serrano et al., 2018). Aß and tau oligomers have been shown to disrupt membrane and synaptic integrity as well as calcium balance, long term potentiation, cellular cytoskeleton and, most importantly, synaptic spines and synaptic communication that leads to progressive cognitive decline (Polanco et al., 2017). The role of tau is more agreed upon compared to the controversy around the consequential role of Aß in the disease process. Nevertheless, there is evidence that suggests a synergistic toxic effect between Aß and tau aggregates which might be exploited by immunotherapy (Pascoal et al., 2017). Some studies suggest that Aß malfunction lies upstream of tau malfunction and triggers tau pathology (Bloom, 2014; Hurtado et al., 2010; Lewis et al., 2001; Götz et al., 2001). However, targeting Aß by immunotherapy did not lead to a decrease in tau pathology nor slowed down cognitive decline in clinical trials (Panza et al., 2019; Medina, 2018). Targeting Aß was shown to be ineffective in early intervention studies in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Cummings et al., 2018). Other studies supporting this idea have shown that Aß pathology itself is not linked to the neurodegeneration and dementia observed (Giacobini and Gold, 2013) but rather, AD development and the associated neurodegeneration correlate to APP malfunction (Lewczuk et al., 2018). Moreover, APP has been shown to be involved in keeping synaptic and axonal integrity (Rusu et al., 2007) and in intracellular transport (Rodrigues et al., 2012; Kametani and Hasegawa, 2018) In addition, APP fragments have been shown to disrupt synaptic plasticity and cellular metabolism, and accumulate in dystrophic neurites (Kametani and Hasegawa, 2018) in both sporadic and familial AD. To add, APP malfunction has been closely linked to tau phosphorylation, aggregation and accumulation (Takahashi et al., 2015). Therefore, all the above support the notion that APP, and not Aß, along with tau are the main drivers of AD. While there are continuous efforts on identifying novel drug targets along the APP metabolism pathway, APP metabolism-targeting therapeutic methods remain far from being established. (Takahashi et al., 2015). On the other hand, tau malfunction correlates with the onset and propagation of AD pathology. In addition, tau load in the brain correlates with cognitive decline, and removal of tau aggregates, in their different forms, have attenuated pathology spread and cognitive decline in animal models. For these reasons, tau-targeted immunotherapy is on the rise. This short review will cover: 1) the latest updates on the current on-going tau-targeted immunotherapy clinical trials, 2) targeting the different pathological forms of tau, 3) the journey to identify biomarkers that will aid in early disease detection and thus early immunotherapy intervention, and 4) a futuristic look onto possible combinational immunotherapy approaches.",
        "conclusion": "A decade of AD studies has led to one major conclusion: AD is one of the most progressive and multifactorial diseases in aging populations. The multifactorial nature of the disease stands between research and therapeutic development and makes it very difficult to stop or prevent disease progression with monotherapy approaches. Years of experimental and monotherapy clinical trials led to many advancements in understanding the complexity and timeline of the disease, identifying pathological protein species, and assessing the feasibility and risks associated with disease modifying therapies. However, most importantly, monotherapy studies have revealed the need for combination therapy approaches to overcome the complexity of the disease (Bittar et al., 2018) . A combination immunotherapy in AD would involve combining passive immunotherapy against multiple pathological proteins like Aß and tau. It is well established now that Aß and tau lie at the base of the pyramid of the AD disease process. Therefore, targeting both pathological forms of the proteins is expected to have a great therapeutic potential. Several studies also show a strong synergistic effect between the two proteins by which Aß exacerbates the toxicity of tau protein (or opposite) and promote further aggregation and propagation. This synergistic effect could be exploited in immunotherapy. Aß immunotherapy helps reduce early hyperphosphorylated tau pathology (Oddo et al., 2004). This highlights the advantage of using immunotherapy to reduce multiple related pathologies. This also further suggests a hierarchical relationship between Aß and tau and thus highlights the importance of using immunotherapy in a timely manner for the highest efficiency. Combination therapy could also imply targeting several pathological forms of the same protein as phospho-tau and tau oligomers. Passive phospho-tau immunotherapy in general proved to be effective in reducing tau pathology and blocking phospho-tau propagation of pathology (Nisbet et al., 2017; Chai et al., 2011). However, very few studies showed an effect with targeting phospho-tau on cognitive decline (Yanamandra et al., 2013). In addition, from those few studies, only a couple phospho-antibodies were tested in aged mice and showed pathology reduction and cognitive improvement (Yanamandra et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2015). The difficulty to obtain cognitive improvement with the successful clearance of insoluble phospho-tau species suggests that the targeted tau species does not play a major role in the process of neurodegeneration leading to cognitive failure. Therefore, soluble forms of pathological tau, like tau oligomers, come into the picture due to their higher toxicity and early on detection in the disease process (Dorey et al., 2015; Sengupta et al., 2017). It is also shown that tau oligomers are found both extracellularly and intracellularly where they exert neuronal toxicity and impair synaptic function. Therefore, due to the mentioned reasons, tau oligomers form an attractive extracellular target for passive immunotherapy. A study by Umeda et al. characterized three monoclonal antibodies that target phospho-tau epitopes, one of which was chosen for an immunotherapy experiment (Ta1505 targeting pSer413) (Umeda et al., 2015). Keeping in mind that the three antibodies exhibited high affinity profiles to their respective epitopes and were very specific to tau species from AD brains, Ta1505 was the only tau antibody that recognized and reduced tau oligomers in addition to pSer413 tau. Interestingly, Ta1505 was the most effective in reversing memory deficits in comparison to age matched (14 month old) controls and clearance of tau oligomers from both intracellular and extracellular spaces. Ta1505 also restored synaptic function shown by restoring the levels of synaptic proteins (Umeda et al., 2015). This provides promising evidence towards the need of targeting more than one toxic tau species at a time to get a better effect. As the field is eagerly waiting on results from ongoing tau-targeted immunotherapy clinical trials, these trials will shape the next era of AD therapeutic developments. Currently, most experimental studies in animal models support the requisite role of pathological tau in AD disease onset and progression, and thus the hopes are very high for tau-targeted treatments. That being said, it is also well established that AD is a complex multifactorial chronological disease. The matter of early treatment intervention is still controversial, as well as Aβ involvement in the disease process and the direction towards Aβ-independent treatments. In addition to pathological proteins, disease cascade involves inflammation and genetic factors that feed into a vicious cycle of continuous progression and, therefore are indispensable in the treatment plan. Is early combination therapy the solution? It is still very early to decide whether early intervention would make a difference and prevent disease progression. However, while it is well documented that when symptoms arise, the brain is already affected by synaptic loss, protein aggregation and inflammation that may not be reversible; multi approach early intervention sounds like a possible and safe venue for disease prevention. In addition, since tau pathology has been shown to start at least a decade before disease symptoms, the field now has a rough estimation on the average age at which early intervention might show promise, depending on the type of dementia. However, applying early intervention on the general population without reliable biomarkers testing preceding the start of the treatment is not practical. Therefore, early detection biomarkers stand out as a must step in testing for disease implications before early intervention. Moreover, routine early biomarker testing would be much more acceptable to the general public than straight forward early immunotherapy for example. At the moment, despite the tremendous efforts, biomarker studies are also still naïve. Nevertheless, with the promising advancements in biomarker studies, we are now closer to early disease detection and thus to early intervention."

        "title": "Astrocytes as a Therapeutic Target in Alzheimer's Disease-Comprehensive Review and Recent Developments.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a frequent and disabling neurodegenerative disorder, in which astrocytes participate in several pathophysiological processes including neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism (along with a critical role in apolipoprotein E function). Current evidence shows that astrocytes have both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects depending on the disease stage and microenvironmental factors. Furthermore, astrocytes appear to be affected by the presence of amyloid-beta (Aβ), with alterations in calcium levels, gliotransmission and proinflammatory activity via RAGE-NF-κB pathway. In addition, astrocytes play an important role in the metabolism of tau and clearance of Aβ through the glymphatic system. In this review, we will discuss novel pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments focused on astrocytes as therapeutic targets for AD. These interventions include effects on anti-inflammatory/antioxidant systems, glutamate activity, lipid metabolism, neurovascular coupling and glymphatic system, calcium dysregulation, and in the release of peptides which affects glial and neuronal function. According to the AD stage, these therapies may be of benefit in either preventing or delaying the progression of the disease.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia (accounting for 60% to 80% of all dementias), and the most frequent neurodegenerative disease in the aging population . AD is a devastating neurological disorder that progressively impairs cognition and memory, severely affecting the quality of life and well-being of patients, family members and caregivers . AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by selective neurodegeneration, abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits and intracellular fibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein . Before amyloid burden, it has been proposed that prefibrillar oligomers affect calcium homeostasis and synaptic transmission . The development of all these pathological features correlates with the clinical appearance of cognitive impairment and dementia . In addition, exacerbated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress have also been observed in brains from individuals with AD, and are current topics of interest in the pathophysiological research of this disease . Various modifiable (diet, lack of exercise, etc.) and non-modifiable (i.e., advanced age) risk factors have been reported for AD . Among the non-modifiable risk factors, several genetic alterations have been associated with either early-onset (familial) or sporadic/late-onset AD forms . For instance, the presence of apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE-ε4) allele, is the main genetic risk factor for late-onset disease , while early-onset disease is more frequently caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and 2 (PSEN2) genes . Astrocytes are the main homeostatic regulators of the central nervous system (CNS) . These cells have crucial functions involving numerous physiological aspects of the brain and spinal cord, including the supply of metabolic substrates to neurons and other glial cells , the regulation of ions and neurotransmitters in the extracellular space , the release of gliotransmitters , and the modulation of synaptic activity , among others. Moreover, astrocytes provide intrinsic neuroprotection to neurons , and currently, these neuroprotective features are being explored as potential therapeutic interventions in numerous conditions such as stroke and neurodegeneration . In addition, astrocytes are functional constituents of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), the neurovascular unit (NVU) , and the glymphatic system . The role astrocytes play in AD is a growing topic of interest due to the involvement of these cells in the pathophysiological processes underlying this disease . Recent research has highlighted the astrocyte’s involvement in neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in AD , the beneficial and detrimental aspects of astrocyte reactivity in AD pathophysiology , the astrocytic-amyloid relationship , and the importance of astrocyte-neuron interactions in AD pathophysiological processes . In AD, various astrocytic functional processes such as calcium signaling, glutamate clearance, extracellular potassium buffering, and energetic metabolism are compromised . In addition, many phenotypic changes have been reported in astrocytes in AD, depicting a large cellular heterogeneity in this disease . In AD experimental mice models, it has been shown that astrocytes migrate in response to chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), present in Aβ plaques, internalizing and degrading amyloid peptides . Moreover, astrocytes, together with microglia, seem to be the drivers of the augmented neuroinflammatory response reported in AD . Furthermore, a recent study showed that glypican-4 (a binding partner of APOE-ε4) secreted by astrocytes, induced tau hyperphosphorylation in a mouse tauopathy model . These findings support an important participation of astrocytes in AD and highlight the need to broaden our comprehension of AD pathogenesis involving glial cells. This approach may allow the identification of specific astrocytic biomarkers for AD , and the possibility of developing AD novel therapeutics based on astrocyte’s pathways and functions . The possible therapeutic value of astrocytes in AD due to their role in senescence, neuroinflammation, neurotrophic factor release and Aβ clearance, has been widely described . In the present article, we will review the effects of both known and novel molecules which act on astrocytes, mentioning new developing therapeutics and pharmacological targets in oxidative stress, neurovascular coupling, excitotoxicity, APOE modulation, among many others, and the way these possible therapeutic approaches could modify either disease instauration or AD progression. In addition, non-pharmacological therapies that impact astrocyte activity will be discussed briefly.",
        "conclusion": "Considering the limitations of the existing AD clinical studies and preclinical models, new approaches have to be implemented. In this regard, astrocyte-focused therapies need to be considered as an important alternative to current AD treatments. These should include interventions aimed to modify neuroinflammation, improve lipid metabolism (alongside with APOE function), and enhance glymphatic system function, among others. Astrocytes must be considered as a key agent in future AD therapeutic approaches due to their crucial role in CNS homeostatic control and the evidenced participation in several aspects of the disease. New targets and mechanisms reviewed here include the up-regulation of EAAT2 or GLT-1 expression, modulation of RAGE-NF-κB and Notch1 signaling pathways, inhibition of the C3/STAT3 pathways, the regulation of the PPARα-dependent pathway, an augmented release of astrocytic IL-3, the up-regulation of SOCS3, the astrocytic SV2A, an indirect modulation of the microglia response, and other astrocyte-specific factors. Since AD is a multifactorial disease, combined therapies with different mechanisms of action (for instance, an inhibitor of RAGE/NF-κB pathway together with a ROS scavenger) may enhance the therapeutic effects of astrocytes in early stages of AD. Additional characteristics of astrocyte-based therapies include numerous effects involving not only glial, but also neuronal and vascular function, together with the modulation of tau phosphorylation and amyloid metabolism. Potential future therapies based on the regulation of astrocyte function could include selective modification of specific gene expression through viral vectors with certain tropism to astrocytes, nanoparticle-delivered astrocytic molecules that cross BBB, extracellular vesicles directed to the SNC that improve astrocyte homeostasis, hybrid drugs with integrated action mechanisms, cell replacement therapy (i.e., graft of astrocytes with a neuroprotective profile), perfusion with glia-conditioned medium derived from astrocytes and molecular induction of astrocytes in a physiological state which may reverse or halt pathological changes in AD."

        "introduction": "Dementia is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 40 million people worldwide. The speed of disease progression is subjective to individual variability but patients are estimated to live from a few up to 20 years after their diagnosis. Dementia is a very burdensome disorder for patients, their family, caretakers and the health care system as a whole (1). The most prevalent cause of dementia is Alzheimer disease (AD), which is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive cognitive and functional impairment and memory loss. Most AD patients are late-onset and sporadic cases with no proven Mendelian pattern of inheritance. The prevalence of the disease increases with life expectancy and affects 10-30% of people aged over 65 years (2). Recently, the FDA approved Aducanumab which is the first medication that aims at treating AD via targeting (one of) the cause(s) of the disease, namely amyloid β (Aβ). However, its therapeutic effect is not yet conclusively proven (3) and next to that only symptomatic medication that is effective for some AD patients is available. Therefore, there is still an urgent need to develop new effective therapies that slow or prevent the progression of AD. During the past years, the Aβ cascade hypothesis has been the most influential model explaining the pathogenesis of AD. This hypothesis proposes that the extracellular deposition of Aβ in the form of neuritic plaques is the initial pathological event in AD that also leads to the intracellular accumulation of abnormal tau proteins in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). These pathological changes, directly or indirectly, induce synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, and ultimately, clinical dementia (4). The steady progress in the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of AD has led to the evaluation of therapies aiming to reduce pathological aggregates of either Aβ or phosphorylated tau (pTau). Unfortunately, none of these strategies has led to clinical success (5–10). As the number of people affected with AD is rising every year, we urgently need to improve our understanding of non-amyloid components and their role in AD pathogenesis. Such new insight may help to identify novel pathways that can be targeted in novel AD therapies. Over the last years, it became increasingly clear that innate immune activation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of AD (11–13). For example, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) show that genes encoding immune receptors such as CR1, CLU, CD33, and TREM2 are linked with AD development (14). Moreover, a new study also identified SYK, GRN, SLC2A5, PYDC1, HEXB, and BLNK (15), genes involved in the regulation of the immune function within and outside the central nervous system (CNS), as risk genes. Taken together, these studies suggest the role of both the central as well as the peripheral immune system in the development and/or progression of AD. In this review, we provide a short summary of the different pathways by which the periphery communicates with the brain. Next, we give a comprehensive overview of the different preclinical as well as clinical studies that link peripheral inflammation to initiation and progression of AD. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of AD pathology that are affected by peripheral inflammation. Lastly, we elaborate on the growing body of evidence indicating that AD may have an underlying intestinal inflammatory process, to which alterations in gut microbiota plays an important role. These insights are essential to broaden our understanding of the mechanisms behind AD pathology and to rationally design new strategies to treat or even prevent the disease.",
        "conclusion": "Increasing evidence indicates that systemic inflammation might drive the initiation and progression of AD. It is becoming increasingly clear that the brain cannot longer be viewed as an immune-privileged region and that CNS inflammation and systemic inflammation are connected to each other. Systemic inflammation rather than Aβ or tau alone may be a key player in AD pathology and its role may precede Aβ deposition. In addition, whether the build-up of Aβ plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation as we age is primarily due to the occurrence of systemic inflammatory events or to other ageing mechanisms is still unclear but it is likely that the combination of different factors, such as inflammaging and microglial priming are crucial. Clearly, continued research in this area is needed to further unravel the effects of systemic inflammation on AD and its mechanisms. Furthermore, this review strengthens the believe that peripheral inflammation worsens AD progression and this opens up a wide range of possible therapeutic strategies for AD via the modulation of peripheral inflammation."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that leads to insidious deterioration of brain functions and is considered the sixth leading cause of death in the world. Alzheimer's patients suffer from memory loss, cognitive deficit and behavioral changes; thus, they eventually follow a low-quality life. AD is considered as a multifactorial disorder involving different neuropathological mechanisms. Recent research has identified more than 20 pathological factors that are promoting disease progression. Three significant hypotheses are said to be the root cause of disease pathology, which include acetylcholine deficit, the formation of amyloid-beta senile plaques and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Apart from these crucial factors, pathological factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE), glycogen synthase kinase 3β, notch signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, etc., are considered to play a role in the advancement of AD and therefore could be used as targets for drug discovery and development. As of today, there is no complete cure or effective disease altering therapies for AD. The current therapy is assuring only symptomatic relief from the disease, and progressive loss of efficacy for these symptomatic treatments warrants the discovery of newer drugs by exploring these novel drug targets. A comprehensive understanding of these therapeutic targets and their neuropathological role in AD is necessary to identify novel molecules for the treatment of AD rationally.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with no cure. It is the most common cause of dementia. There are about 40 million people with AD; most of them are above 65 years of age . People affected with AD show disorientation, cognitive impairment, memory loss, behavioral changes leading to poor-quality life. The pathophysiology behind this disease is complex and not fully figured out. Leading causes behind the disease are found to be the increased activity of acetylcholinesterase, which eventually leads to a decrease in the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, the formation of senile plaques of Aβ and inflammation of neuronal cells in the brain . Besides this, there are some other factors, which modulate the progression of AD, and they include genetic factors, apoptosis, mitochondria-mediated, atrophy, etc. These factors were figured out recently, and the recent studies are rolling on these factors, how they are involved in the advancement of the disease, and their role in developing effective drugs for AD. Currently, there are only four drugs in the market that could be used for the treatment of AD, and they are donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine. One more drug, tacrine, which was an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was withdrawn from the market due to its toxicity. These drugs can provide only symptomatic relief from the disease . One of the widely accepted mechanisms for AD development is considered to be low levels of acetylcholine in the brain due to increased acetylcholinesterase activity, eventually leading to progressive cognitive decline. The use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors has been proved to be beneficial in improving the disease symptoms and also could reduce amyloid protein plaques. In this context, extensive research has been carried out in search of promising acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that could be used in the treatment of AD. Recent advances in molecular modelling software enable the medicinal chemist to design novel molecules based on the three-dimensional structure of acetylcholinesterase. In silico docking studies trace out the drug-receptor interaction, which could be synthesized and evaluated for anti-Alzheimer’s activity. Recent research in the field has made remarkable progress by identifying novel small molecules such as selenium-containing hydrochloride derivatives , triazole ring-containing compounds , chalcones , and sulfur-containing motifs exhibiting remarkable acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. Fig. (1) shows significant changes in the brain during the progression of AD.",
        "conclusion": "AD is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease with no cure. Accumulation of toxic proteins, including alpha-synuclein (Lewy bodies), beta-amyloid plaques, Tau tangles, and TDP-43 is considered as pathophysiology involved in neurodegeneration and these are often used as probable molecular biomarkers to predict disease progression. Significantly altered neurotransmission of dopamine and acetylcholine can also lead to neuronal degeneration. Currently, available drugs for the treatment of AD belong to the category of either acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist. These drugs are only useful during the first year of treatment for patients with mild to moderate AD and provide some degree of improvement in cognitive functions. The efficacy of these drugs declines wholly and subsequently vanishes after 2 to 3 years of treatment. The progressive loss of efficacy for these symptomatic treatments warrants the necessity of identifying newer targets for novel small molecule drug interventions. The major difficulty in treating AD is due to the activation of several harmful processes in the brain. To effectively prevent the progress of these destructive processes in the brain, it is necessary to address them simultaneously. In case of such complex disease pathologies, single-target drugs are inadequate to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Therefore newer multi-target drugs (MTDs) should be designed to simultaneously target several aspects of disease pathology leading to neuronal damage rather than just the symptoms currently addressed by single-target drugs. Further, it is well proven that MTDs have a better safety profile when compared to single-targeted ones. AD is the sixth leading cause of death worldwide. It is a complex neurological disorder with learning and memory impairment and other behavioral changes. There is no such cure for the disease, and only four drugs are available in the market for symptomatic relief of this illness. Major hypotheses include the deficit of acetylcholine, the formation of Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangle formation (NFT) and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Other than these hypotheses, there underlie many other pathophysiologies that modify the causes of AD. In various studies, it is evident that there are more than 20 pathophysiological factors involved in altering this disease progression and development. Therefore, inhibition or activation of these factors could modify the advancement of AD, and those agents used for the same could be another choice of drug for the condition. These factors are all interconnected in a way or the other and imbalance of any of these may facilitate disease progression. Every one of them ends up to the same cardinal hypotheses such as the formation of senile Aβ plaques, tau protein hyperphosphorylation or formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In this review, we discuss the main pathways that underlie neurodegeneration in AD, and this could provide a thorough understanding of different neurodegenerative mechanisms that help in the design and development of novel target-based small molecules for the treatment of AD."

        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36207441/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder estimated to affect nearly 30 million people worldwide1. AD is the most common cause of dementia in mid- and late-life, but its clinical impact is modified by other neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions (e.g., impairment in memory, judgment, decision making, distorted language, and physical orientation)2,3. Over the last years, significant advances were made in the understanding of AD by investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloid-β peptides and protein tau, both hallmarks of this disease. Despite this progress, no disease-modifying treatments currently exist in AD. Indeed, the amyloid-β and tau biomarkers are very useful in tracking AD progression but, unfortunately, they have not yet translated into treatments for AD. Thus, the identification of novel and effective molecular biomarkers for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD is urgently demanded. In this perspective, fundamental insights may come from the new emerging research area of Network Medicine, which exploits concepts garnered from network theory to elucidate the relation between perturbations in the human interactome (i.e., the network of all physical interactions within a cell, from protein–protein to regulatory protein–DNA and metabolic interactions) and phenotypic disease manifestations4. In particular, an extensive literature on this topic demonstrated that the molecular determinants associated with a given disease (named disease genes) are not randomly scattered, but form locally dense and topologically/functionally well-defined regions in the human interactome (named disease modules)5–10. More precisely, the fundamental hypotheses of Network Medicine state that the molecular determinants associated with a specific disease: (i) have an increased tendency to interact with each other (local hypothesis); (ii) show a tendency to cluster in the same network neighbourhood (disease module hypothesis); (iii) show a tendency to be involved in closely disease-related cellular functions or causal molecular pathways (functional coherence hypothesis)4,7. These observations have fueled the development of numerous algorithms to interrogate disease etiology, model molecular and genetic interactions, identify potential biomarkers, and design therapeutic interventions9. Such algorithms were highly customized according to the study design, the phenotype under investigation, the biological question of interest, the molecular entities measured, and the type and size of the available datasets. Several of these algorithms10–12 make use of the human interactome, also denoted as protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, and of the a priori knowledge of disease genes defined as genes with mutations known to have a phenotypic impact13,14. Among them, one of the most well-established algorithm is DIAMOnD (DIseAse MOdule Detection)12, which was designed to predict the full disease module around a set of known disease associated proteins (called seed proteins) in the human interactome by performing a systematic analysis which prioritizes the proteins having a significant fraction of their interactions with the seed proteins. Other algorithms make use of gene expression networks (GENs) that are built by calculating correlations between the expression profiles of each gene pair. Among them, one of the most promising algorithm is SWIM (SWItch Miner)15, which was designed to predict important (switch) genes within GENs that are associated with intriguing patterns of molecular co-abundance and may play a key role in phenotypic transitions in various biological settings2,15–18. In particular, switch genes are defined as a special set of genes with peculiar topological features within GENs, i.e.: (i) they show coherent patterns of correlation, suggesting they may be co-regulated or functionally related; (ii) they form localized connected subnetworks/modules; (iii) they are not local hub within their module, but they act as connectors able to convey information among modules of the correlation network. Summarizing, while PPI networks leverage experimentally confirmed interactomics data pointing out physical and functional interactions occurring among proteins, GENs leverage phenotype-specific gene expression data resulting in a context-specific gene interaction network. Here, to combine the strengths of both methodologies, we integrated the DIAMOnD and SWIM results by mapping the list of the AD-specific switch genes in the subnetwork of the human interactome constituted by the nearest neighbours of the AD-associated seed proteins. Regarding AD gene expression data, there exist several publically available datasets. For example, Liang et al. collected transcriptomic data coming from post-mortem brain tissue and identified region-specific gene expression alterations in AD brains19. In this study, we decided to pursue a blood-based gene expression analysis since the identification of a blood-based diagnostic signature could be extremely useful for pre-screening ahead of invasive and costly follow-up analysis20–22. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers represent an ideal option as the first-step of the diagnostic process beginning in primary care settings, and may help to determine which individuals should receive a referral to assessment by specialists, including CSF analysis, MRI or amyloid PET diagnostics. Another advantage is that blood testing is already a well-established part of clinical routines, requiring no further training for health care professionals. In addition, the use of blood-based biomarkers may offer the possibility to test a wide range of other candidate pathophysiological biomarkers, reflecting the full spectrum of disease and driving molecular mechanisms underlying AD, beyond the standard amyloid- and tau-based tests21. Our network medicine approach led to an in silico recognition of a novel disease gene signature for AD composed of proteins (14 switch genes plus the already known 99 AD-associated seed proteins) having unique, quantifiable characteristics that distinguish them from the other nodes in the human interactome: they are physically and functionally related and AD phenotype-specific in the human interactome. We believe that our findings could provide advancements in the ongoing effort to identify effective diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD so to improve the clinical management of this dreadful disease.",
        "conclusion": "In the last few years, the new paradigm of Network Medicine overcame the conventional medicine paradigm ‘one gene, one drug, one disease’ mainly focused on treating the symptoms rather than discovering the causes of diseases4,5. According to the Network Medicine paradigm, diseases are rarely caused by a single gene mutation, but more typically by the deregulation of a set of genes interconnected with each other within the human interactome. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly evident that the molecular determinants associated with a given disease (named disease genes) have a high propensity to agglomerate in specific regions of the interactome, suggesting the existence of specific disease network modules for each disease5–10. Thus, identifying fully these disease modules and understanding the effects of their perturbations on disease onset and progression could lead to unveil new diagnostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. Following this innovative vision of medicine, in the present paper, we carried out a computational analysis by integrating consolidated network-medicine tools and concepts in order to unveil novel putative disease genes associated with one of the most common and awful neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., the Alzheimer’s disease. In particular, we exploited the DIAMOnD methodology12 combined with the SWIM methodology15,30 to enlarge the set of known AD-associated genes (seed) with additional 14 genes having peculiar and crucial characteristics, i.e.:they have a significant fraction of their interactions with the seed of AD in the human interactome (Fig. 1);they have biological characteristics similar to the seed of AD (Fig. 3);they are switch genes that are similarly modulated (all up-regulated in AD) and are important inter-module connectors in the gene co-expression network (Table 3 and Fig. 4);they form a statistically significant disease module in the human interactome (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figure 2). We finally investigated the current biological knowledge of the 14-gene signature in the AD framework. The AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) is a key player in the signaling of insulin and other growth factors and its alterations were widely associated with AD pathology and lower cognitive function37,38. Indeed, insulin and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway have a significant role in neuronal health as well as synapse formation and maintenance39. Interestingly, enhancement of PI3K-AKT signaling in the central nervous system by intranasal insulin treatments was shown to improve memory in vivo in mice and in human trials38. Also, the inositol polyphosphate phosphatase like 1 (INPPL1), which encodes the protein SHIP2, play a key role in the regulation of insulin function and growth factor receptors turnover. The study by Mostafavi et al.40 showed that the upregulation of INPPL1 gene significantly correlates with cognitive decline in human AD patients. Other independent studies reported SHIP2 functions as a mediator of amyloid toxicity via tau hyperphosphorylation41 and actin-cytoskeleton reorganization42. The Cbl proto-oncogene (CBL) encodes a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is an enzyme required for targeting substrates for degradation by the proteasome. Several studies have indicated that CBL functions as a negative regulator of many signal transduction pathways43,44, and in particular, it could suppress the Src-family tyrosine kinase Fyn previously identified as potential target for AD45. Another member of Src family of tyrosine kinases is the HCK proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase (HCK). In particular, HCK is a hematopoietic cell kinase whose dysregulation may affect microglia (i.e., resident immune cells in the central nervous system playing critical roles in brain immunity, development, and homeostasis) and accelerate early stage Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology46. Recently, also the colony stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) and the docking protein 3 (DOK3) was found to be involved in the in microglial cell activation47,48. The protein kinase C delta (PRKCD) encodes one of the protein kinase C family members that are involved in physiological processes related to learning and memory, and thus have been classified as cognitive kinases. Besides their implication in memory and cognition, PKC family members were found to regulate several pathways relevant for AD pathophysiology and thus proposed as potential therapeutic strategy against AD49. To our knowledge, there currently exist no studies associating the tyrosine kinase non receptor 2 (TNK2) as well as the WASP actin nucleation promoting factor (WAS) with the etiology and pathogenesis of AD. Finally, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A) and 5B (STAT5A), and the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) are key components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway which seems to promote neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases50. The present study showed how a systematic analysis exploiting tools and concepts of the new paradigm of Network Medicine can improve the prediction of a novel AD gene signature that may contribute to the pathological phenotype. Indeed, our network-based pipeline allowed to complement the current knowledge of AD-associated genes, mainly stemmed from GWAS analysis, with additional putative AD biomarkers, mainly stemmed from measuring transcript abundance and gene expression patterns. It is worth stressing that our study has a purely computational nature and experimental validations would be necessary to investigate the actual role of the identified genes as AD biomarkers. However, we believe that our findings could deepen the understanding of mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis, maybe suggesting new potential diagnostic biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for this awful neurodegenerative disease."

        "abstract": "Damage or loss of brain cells and impaired neurochemistry, neurogenesis, and synaptic and nonsynaptic plasticity of the brain lead to dementia in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Injury to synapses and neurons and accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are considered the main morphological and neuropathological features of AD. Age, genetic and epigenetic factors, environmental stressors, and lifestyle contribute to the risk of AD onset and progression. These risk factors are associated with structural and functional changes in the brain, leading to cognitive decline. Biomarkers of AD reflect or cause specific changes in brain function, especially changes in pathways associated with neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, bioenergetics, apoptosis, and oxidative and nitrosative stress. Even in the initial stages, AD is associated with Aβ neurotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and tau neurotoxicity. The integrative amyloid-tau-mitochondrial hypothesis assumes that the primary cause of AD is the neurotoxicity of Aβ oligomers and tau oligomers, mitochondrial dysfunction, and their mutual synergy. For the development of new efficient AD drugs, targeting the elimination of neurotoxicity, mutual potentiation of effects, and unwanted protein interactions of risk factors and biomarkers (mainly Aβ oligomers, tau oligomers, and mitochondrial dysfunction) in the early stage of the disease seems promising.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and the most common cause of AD dementia is neuronal death and loss of synapses in certain areas of the brain. AD has been defined as a clinical dementia syndrome confirmed at autopsy or in vivo by the neuropathological observation of neuritic plaques composed of amyloid beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of paired helical filaments of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (tau). Other typical abnormalities in the brains of AD patients include neuronal loss, synaptic alterations, and neuroinflammation . Critical roles in AD pathogenesis have been assigned to Aβ metabolism , tauopathy , mitochondrial dysfunction , and oxidative stress , among other pathways. At the cellular, subcellular, and biochemical levels, AD can be viewed as a proteinopathy with an excessive accumulation of extracellular densely packed Aβ filaments and intraneuronal NFTs in the brain. Soluble Aβ and tau oligomers are responsible for neuronal damage and death by disrupting brain chemistry and synaptic plasticity ; thus, AD can also be viewed as and oligomeropathy . Soluble Aβ and tau oligomers can propagate via prion-like mechanisms in the brain . Aβ oligomers trigger the conversion of tau to the toxic oligomeric form; at the same time, through a feedback loop, tau can increase in the toxicity of Aβ oligomers . Neuroinflammation , oxidative stress , and disruption of metabolic pathways are involved in the complex cascade leading to AD pathology and symptoms. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction is thought to play a critical role in both the accumulation and deposition of Aβ , tau hyperphosphorylation, and intracellular NFT formation in AD. Mitochondrial dysfunction leading to impaired bioenergetics and calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, membrane depolarization and permeabilization, and apoptosis plays a key role in the initiation and/or regulation of all cellular processes, including the neurotoxicity of Aβ and tau . AD biomarkers include genetic, biochemical, physiological, and neuroimaging parameters involved in neurodegeneration, impaired neuroplasticity, and brain structure and function damage. AD is classified as an Aβ and tau pathology leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment . The onset of AD and disease progression are determined by a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors and biomarkers, resulting in disturbances in various brain areas and neurocircuits, neurodegeneration, and impaired neuroplasticity and neurochemistry, which are responsible for disease symptoms (Figure 1). Most cases of AD are recognized after age 65 and are called sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD). In 5–10% of cases there is an earlier onset of the disease; this form of AD is referred to as familial early onset AD (EOAD) and is strongly genetically determined. Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) is defined as dominantly inherited AD with pathological confirmation. ADAD occurs in less than 1% of all cases in which dementia develops at a predictable age, due to specific genetic mutations. The study of ADAD makes it possible to determine the sequence of changes in biomarkers in persons destined to develop genetically conditioned AD . For LOAD, this sequence may or may not be the same. ADAD, EOAD, and LOAD are thought to share similar pathophysiological features. Currently, there is only symptomatic treatment for AD . Progress in understanding the regulatory processes underlying neurodegeneration and finding specific and sensitive biomarkers of prodromal and early stage of AD are necessary to enable diagnosis of incipient AD and the development of disease-modifying (causal) drugs for initial treatment of the disease. This review summarizes findings on risk factors and biomarkers of AD that are associated with changes in brain chemistry and neuroplasticity leading to neurodegeneration. The role of Aβ, tau, and mitochondria in the development of AD is presented in terms of the search for primary causes and triggers of AD and their mutual interactions leading to neurodegeneration. The integrative amyloid-tau-mitochondrial hypothesis of AD captures the interconnection of the main causes of neurodegeneration in AD and reflects the time course of biomarkers, mitochondrial targets of Aβ and tau, and the complex and multifactorial nature of AD. Finally, the cellular targets of AD drugs are summarized, particularly candidate drugs developed to eliminate neurodegeneration in the early stage of the disease. Article search was conducted primarily using PubMed with searches based on combinations of keywords “Alzheimer’s disease”, “amyloid beta”, “mitochondria”, “tau”, and “drug”.",
        "conclusion": "Aβ and tau pathology and mitochondrial dysfunction are implicated in the etiology of AD. The neurotoxicity of soluble Aβ oligomers is thought to be predominant in the preclinical stage of the disease, while soluble tau oligomers are involved in the progression of neurodegeneration in the prodromal period and in dementia . However, it cannot be ruled out, at least in some AD cases, that Aβ toxicity is initiated and potentiated by mitochondrial dysfunction and/or P-tau. The possibility of a causal treatment for AD is based on the recognition and elimination or reduction of the primary causes of the disease, which can be derived from risk factors and biomarkers measurable at an early stage of the disease. Insights into risk factors, biomarkers, the time course of biomarkers, Aβ and tau neurotoxicity, metabolic and mitochondrial dysregulation, and disruption of signaling pathways and neuroplasticity, along with new insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and the mitochondrial targets of Aβ and tau, support an interlinking of the amyloid, tau, and mitochondrial hypotheses. The integrative amyloid-tau-mitochondrial hypothesis posits that risk factors and metabolic changes trigger a primary specific cause of AD development, which is mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity of Aβ oligomers or neurotoxicity of tau oligomers, and the mutual feedback and synergistic interactions of these primary causes lead to neurodegeneration. Pharmacological intervention with the potential to be causal includes targeting on the production, elimination, and spread of (i) Aβ oligomers to prevent disease onset , (ii) tau oligomers and NFTs to eliminate disease progression , and (iii) mitochondrial dysfunction to reduce the progression of neurodegeneration . Based on the integrated amyloid-tau-mitochondrial hypothesis, understanding the mechanism underlying the mitochondrial action of Aβ and tau oligomers and assessing the protective effects of novel AD drugs against the mitochondrial toxicity of Aβ and tau is essential for the successful development of new AD drugs that can effectively/causally treat the disease. It seems appropriate to target signaling pathways involved in feedback links between mitochondria and Aβ and tau; however, these pathways must first be examined in detail."

        "title": "Emerging insights into synapse dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and a growing worldwide problem, with its incidence expected to increase in the coming years. Since synapse loss is a major pathology and is correlated with symptoms in Alzheimer's disease, synapse dysfunction and loss may underlie pathophysiology. In this context, this review focuses on emerging insights into synaptic changes at the ultrastructural level. The three-dimensional electron microscopy technique unequivocally detects all types of synapses, including multi-synapses, which are indicators of synaptic connectivity between neurons. In recent years it has become feasible to perform sophisticated three-dimensional electron microscopy analyses on post-mortem human Alzheimer's disease brain as tissue preservation and electron microscopy techniques have improved. This ultrastructural analysis found that synapse loss does not always precede neuronal loss, as long believed. For instance, in the transentorhinal cortex and area CA1 of the hippocampus, synapse loss does not precede neuronal loss. However, in the entorhinal cortex, synapse loss precedes neuronal loss. Moreover, the ultrastructural analysis provides details about synapse morphology. For example, changes in excitatory synapses' post-synaptic densities, with fragmented postsynaptic densities increasing at the expense of perforated synapses, are seen in Alzheimer's disease brain. Further, multi-synapses also appear to be altered in Alzheimer's disease by doubling the abundance of multi-innervated spines in the transentorhinal cortex of Alzheimer's disease brain. Collectively, these recent ultrastructural analyses highlight distinct synaptic phenotypes in different Alzheimer's disease brain regions and broaden the understanding of synapse alterations, which may unravel some new therapeutic targets.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia. Growing evidence suggests that memory impairment in Alzheimer’s disease correlates with synapse loss in the forebrain.1–5 For instance, synapse loss in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus and superior frontal cortex negatively correlates with performance in various types of memory tasks.6–10 Given this correlation, it is important to understand how synapses are affected in Alzheimer’s disease in order to be able to intervene and reverse synaptic changes to possibly prevent and/or rescue cognitive and memory impairment. To this date, several methods have been used to assess synapse density. For example, indirect quantification of pre- and post-synaptic proteins, such as synaptophysin, synapsin-1 and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) by immunohistochemistry, ELISA, dot-blot and western blot.4,9,11–15 However, these methods estimate, at very best, the presence of specific synaptic proteins in the pre- or post-synaptic compartments, but they cannot provide the detailed context of pre- and post-synaptic architecture and determine the progression of pathology in the disease. For example, the presynaptic marker CSPalpha is reduced in Alzheimer’s disease before synaptophysin levels are affected,16 suggesting that at least some synaptic markers can have a reduction in expression without any impact on synapse numbers. Further, DeKosky and colleagues4 did not find a correlation between synaptophysin expression and cognitive function, even though synapse density correlated with cognitive abilities, showing the inaccuracy of relying on synaptic protein expression as markers for synapses. It is also very common to assess synapse density and morphology by fluorescence imaging of dendritic spines. However, it should be noted that such imaging does not assure that the dendritic spines have a presynaptic input, and it can also not distinguish between multi-synapses and one-input-one-spine synapses, except for the recently developed super-resolution imaging with the DNA-paint method for cultured neurons.17,18 Further, subcellular components within the spines, such as the spine apparatus, cannot be identified with light microscopy in contrast with electron microscopy (EM). To study how synapses are changed in Alzheimer’s disease, it is important to use methods that allow for the unequivocal identification of synapses. EM is the gold standard for ultrastructure assay since it provides sufficient high resolution for a clear visualization of PSDs and presynaptic vesicles, making it possible to identify a synaptic connection on the nanometric scale (Fig. 1). EM also allows for the identification of synapses and their classification into asymmetric synapses (AS) and symmetric synapses (SS). This distinction is important as these two types of synapses correlate with different functions: AS are mostly glutamatergic and excitatory, while SS are mostly GABAergic and inhibitory.19 Serial sectioning TEM is a well-established technique to obtain three-dimensional data from ultrathin sections of brain tissue. However, obtaining a long series of ultrathin sections is extremely time-consuming, difficult and requires labour-intensive human interaction that prevents this approach from being widely employed (reviewed in20). However, the development of automated EM techniques represents an important advance. One of these techniques of three-dimensional (3D)-EM, called dual-beam microscopy, combines a high-resolution field-emission SEM column with a focused gallium ion beam (FIB), which permits the removal of thin layers of material from the sample surface on a nanometer scale. As soon as one layer of material is removed by the FIB, the exposed surface of the sample is imaged by the SEM using a backscattered electron detector. The sequential automated use of FIB milling and SEM imaging allows for obtaining long series of photographs of a 3D sample of selected brain regions (e.g. see reference 21). The FIB/SEM microscopy offers the advantage that the process of obtaining serial images is fully automated, eliminating the need for serial sectioning, the collection of ultrathin sections and the manual acquisition of microphotographs. Indeed, FIB/SEM is an excellent tool to study in detail the ultrastructure and alterations of the synaptic organization of the human brain, as shown by Blazquez- Blazquez-Llorca et al.22 who studied AD human tissue for the first time using this technique. Further, 3D EM is essential to identify synapses that have connections with multiple dendritic spines or with multiple presynaptic terminals, which can be considered as multi-output and multi-input, respectively (Fig. 2). Correspondingly, these synapse types are named multi-innervated spines (MIS) and multi-spine boutons (MSBs). 3D EM can identify and reconstruct the post-synaptic densities (PSDs) as independent elements, which can be achieved only by a 3D analysis at the EM level (Fig. 3) and will provide the ultrastructure synapse architecture in the brain. Multi-synapses in Alzheimer’s disease have been overlooked for many years, but it is paramount to study these types of synapses as the presence and/or proportions of both types of multi-synapses change the connectivity between neurons and seem to contribute to learning and memory.23 For instance, Geinisman24 reported that trace eyeblink conditioning in rabbits increases MSB density in hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum. Similarly, aged mice, as well as mutants with impaired long-term potentiation, are able to form and store hippocampal-dependent memories through the formation of MIS.25–27 Therefore, given the contribution of multi-synapses to cognition and memory, it is important to be able to identify and analyse these types of synapses in Alzheimer’s disease. Despite providing resolution at the nanoscale level, to undoubtedly identify synapses, synapse types and subcellular structures, EM has some limitations. For instance, it is not possible to use EM imaging in living organisms; therefore, longitudinal studies to assess synaptic alteration during disease progression are not possible. Also, 3D-EM synapse reconstruction and analysis are very time-consuming. Reviewed data come from FIB/SEM studies performed on human brain samples from control and AD cases (for details, see references 28–32). Briefly, brain tissue samples with a very short post-mortem delay (less than 4 h) were fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, the tissue was coronally sectioned. Serial sections were post-fixed and stained with uranyl acetate and then dehydrated and flat-embedded in Araldite.33 Embedded sections were glued onto a block. Blocks were glued onto a sample stub, and the top surface was coated with a layer of gold/palladium to facilitate charge dissipation. The blocks were used to obtain images stacks using a dual-beam microscope (FIB/SEM; Crossbeam® 540 electron microscope, Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany). FIB/SEM images were obtained avoiding the neuronal and glial somata, blood vessels and also Aβ plaques in order to eliminate the effect of alterations of synapses in the vicinity of Aβ-plaques, which has been described previously (e.g. see22) FIBSEM images were analysed using EspINA software, which allows for the 3-dimensional reconstruction of synapses (Video 1). In this review, we will focus on the emerging insights of synaptic changes in post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease brain derived from recent 3D EM analyses, which became feasible due to very short post-mortem delay to assure high tissue preservation. An example of a post-mortem EM image is presented in Fig. 1. This analysis provides the best knowledge to date about ultrastructural changes in synapses in Alzheimer’s disease, which is essential for an understanding of the mechanisms underlying synaptic degeneration in the disease. There is a notion that 3D EM analysis occasionally contradicts what was observed with traditional EM analysis, such as in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.7 However, it is mandatory that more brain regions are analysed using 3D EM before reaching any general conclusion.",
        "conclusion": "Despite all research looking at synaptic alterations in Alzheimer’s disease, many outstanding questions remain to be addressed. With the development of newer and more advanced techniques, such as 3D EM and super-resolution imaging, along with the possibility of obtaining post-mortem brain tissue with minimal post-mortem delay and ensuring better tissue preservation, more detailed analyses can be carried out. Detailed synapse analysis is feasible, for instance, looking at specific synapse types (excitatory and inhibitory, macular and non-macular, etc), the location of the synapse within the post-synaptic cell (spine head, neck or dendritic shaft) as well as the quantification of multi-synapses (MIS and MSB). Therefore, recent studies using this technique have overcome some of the previous limitations and will provide a better and more accurate understanding of the disease pathology. Regarding synapse and neuronal loss, it seems there is no homogeneity throughout the post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease brain, with synapse loss being associated with neuronal death in some but not all brain regions.29–31 This suggests different levels of resilience against synaptic dysfunction and degeneration between brain subregions. In order to target synaptic pathology in the most vulnerable regions, we need to understand what causes synapses to be more resistant towards dysfunction and degeneration in these areas. Excitatory and inhibitory synapses seem to be equally lost in Alzheimer’s disease, but more studies in other brain regions are needed in order to find whether this is a general principle in Alzheimer’s disease. There is also no uniformity regarding changes in PSD morphology and synapse location within the post-synaptic cell in Alzheimer’s disease brains. These alterations appear to happen in specific neurons, with excitatory neurons being more affected.28,29,31 Changes in PSD morphology and synapse location could affect synapse function, maybe altering the excitatory-inhibitory balance, and affecting the cellular mechanism of learning and memory. Therefore, it is important to investigate why these particular synapses are altered and the implications of these changes. Notably, 3D EM studies did not detect any synapse enlargement in most areas of the Alzheimer’s disease brain, in contrast to what has been reported before.10,41–44 Therefore, the maintenance of the total synaptic contact area also appears not to be a general feature of Alzheimer’s disease. However, these studies looked at neuropil synapses; therefore, a compensatory enlargement of perisomatic synapses cannot be ruled out. Unfortunately, studies using 3D EM to analyse post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease brains are still scarce, and this makes it difficult to know if synaptic enlargement may be a feature of synapses on cell bodies and/or in other brain regions. It is also important to know why in the transentorhinal cortex specific neuropil synapses and not others get bigger, what mechanisms underlie the size alteration and if these enlarged synapses are conserved, maybe in an attempt to store memories, or per contra, if they are in the process of dying. Finally, MIS and MSBs also seem to be altered in Alzheimer’s disease. The reported changes could be part of a compensatory mechanism, trying to regain brain connectivity, leading to the disruption of stored memories. However, more 3D-EM analyses should be done to investigate whether these are common alterations in different brain areas and also if they represent an increased connectivity between the same neurons or a higher connectivity between different cells. Despite the detailed ultrastructural analyses that 3D EM can offer, many questions remain unanswered. It is not yet clear why resilience towards synapse degeneration appears to be higher in some brain regions or why PSD morphology and synapse location are more commonly altered in excitatory synapses. Further, the role of abnormally enlarged neuropil synapses in the transentorhinal cortex and whether their formation should be enhanced or prevented or how this can be done also remains unknown. In addition, MIS and MSBs appear to be vulnerable in the transentorhinal cortex, but it still is unclear what their exact role is and whether they are important for memory storage or retrieval. In order to tackle these questions, more studies are still needed in more brain regions to further investigate synaptic changes. Analyses of post-mortem brain tissue at the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease will also be necessary to discern between primary and secondary changes in association with pathology. Further, while 3D-EM is the gold standard for synapse identification, molecular mechanisms cannot be very well studied using this technique, as it involves immuno-EM, a laborious procedure for which it may be difficult to find suitable antibodies. However, single-molecule imaging techniques, such as super resolution microscopy (SRM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) or DNA paint, are more suitable to study molecular mechanisms.48 On the other hand, these techniques cannot be used to identify multiple synapses, and they are not very well established for in vivo or in situ work. Therefore, findings using 3D-EM could be translated and looked at with a single-molecule imaging technique in order to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic changes. For instance, findings using array tomography suggest that synapse density is decreased in proximity to amyloid oligomers surrounding plaques, and it increases in an approximately linear manner to reach similar levels as controls at 50 µm from a plaque.49 Similarly, FIB/SEM imaging has shown that the closer to an amyloid plaque, the smaller the number of synapses.22 Therefore, in the future, these techniques could be combined to investigate synaptic changes within 50 µm from an amyloid plaque and also to study the effects of hyperphosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles in synapses. This can aid in finding the most accurate readout of pathophysiology to identify and study molecular and mechanistic processes happening in Alzheimer’s disease, which will deepen the understanding of disease-associated pathology and facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets."

Patients with AD generally exhibit neuroinflammation, elevated beta-amyloid (Aβ), tau phosphorylation (p-tau), and other pathological changes in the brain. The kynurenine pathway (KP) and several of its metabolites, especially quinolinic acid (QA), are considered to be involved in the neuropathogenesis of AD. The important metabolites and key enzymes show significant importance in neuroinflammation and AD. Meanwhile, the discovery of changed levels of KP metabolites in patients with AD suggests that KP metabolites may have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD. Further, some KP metabolites exhibit other effects on the brain, such as oxidative stress regulation and neurotoxicity. Both analogs of the neuroprotective and antineuroinflammation metabolites and small molecule enzyme inhibitors preventing the formation of neurotoxic and neuroinflammation compounds may have potential therapeutic significance.

        "introduction": "Over 55 million people globally live with dementia, but only 25% are properly diagnosed since diagnostic criteria for dementia are unclear . Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia. The primary clinical manifestation of AD is cognitive impairment, characterized by a comprehensive decline in cognitive, behavioral, language, and other brain functions. Pathological manifestations of AD involve the extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Aβ), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), tau phosphorylation (p-tau), and so on. Currently, the pathogenesis of AD remains unknown and many hypotheses are based on observed pathological changes (e.g., the Aβ waterfall hypothesis) . The discovery of inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin- (IL-) 1β , and AD risk genes associated with innate immune function, apolipoprotein E (APOE) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), in AD patients suggests that neuroinflammation is essential in pathogenesis . The kynurenine pathway (KP) is crucial for peripheral and central catabolism of the essential amino acid, L-tryptophan (L-TRP). An imbalance in KP metabolism is a significant contributor to neuroinflammation. For example, overactivation of KP may result in excessive production of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA) by activated microglia and perivascular and infiltrating macrophages . A low level of cinnabarinic acid (CA) likely protects neurons but can be oxidized by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA) to produce free radical superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide . Conversely, picolinic acid (PA) has a dual function in immune regulation and can limit the excitatory toxicity of QA . An interaction exists between KP metabolite imbalance and neuroinflammation. In a case-control study of clinical and biomarker-confirmed AD patients and cognitively healthy controls with paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, metabolic profiling has been performed and the results showed that the specific association of amino acids and L-TRP catabolites with AD CSF biomarkers suggests a close relationship with core AD pathology . And another metabolomic analysis of AD patients and healthy seniors suggests that the involvement of polyamine and L-TRP-KYN metabolisms was observed in the postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (PCSF) samples . In addition, studies found that KP metabolites are associated with pathological changes and cognitive function in AD, such as QA [7–9, 15–25]. This work first discusses the mechanisms of AD neuroinflammation and KP regulation. Second, we summarized the relationship between neuroinflammation in AD and significant KP metabolites and molecular mechanisms. Ultimately, we discuss the applicability of KP metabolites as biomarkers for AD and provide references for the search for biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",
        "conclusion": "L-TRP metabolism by the KP regulates inflammation, immunity, and tumor progression. KP signaling is the result of various metabolic influences, such as inflammatory factors, and the early discovery of metabolites can support the early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Firstly, studies suggested that peripheral inflammatory factors played a key role in the early stage of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier . Therefore, we should take a holistic view of inflammation that peripheral inflammation was associated with neuroinflammation. Secondly, KP metabolites and molecular mechanisms are complex and most of them have yet to be explored. Different biomarkers are the most appropriate from the perspective of molecular mechanisms and existing biomarker exploration. KYN, 3-HANA, and CA have an antineuroinflammatory effect which can inhibit AD. It is found that KYNA can lead to cognitive impairment. 3-HK, QA, and PA have neurotoxicity and promote AD. QA is also supposed to be closely related to the formation of Aβ and p-tau and to promote neuroinflammation. According to existing studies, elevated QA promotes pathological changes and neuroinflammation in AD. However, KYN might be more advantageous as a biomarker in related studies. This may be because QA poorly diffuses across the BBB and mainly exists in the CNS, while KYN can cross the BBB through the large neutral amino acid transporter. We consider that KYN might be more advantageous as a biomarker, while QA might be more advantageous as a therapeutic target. Therefore, future studies should carefully explore the biological functions of various important KP metabolites. Further mechanistic studies are needed to link KP metabolites with AD. However, modulation of the KP at various points in the pathway is likely to be beneficial. KP metabolites, enzyme inhibitors, and neutralizing antibodies are future therapeutic strategies in neurological disease."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative disorder in the elderly in developed countries. Currently, growing evidence is pointing at endothelial dysfunction as a key player in the cognitive decline course of AD. As a main component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the dysfunction of endothelial cells driven by vascular risk factors associated with AD allows the passage of toxic substances to the cerebral parenchyma, producing chronic hypoperfusion that eventually causes an inflammatory and neurotoxic response. In this process, the levels of several biomarkers are disrupted, such as an increase in adhesion molecules that allow the passage of leukocytes to the cerebral parenchyma, increasing the permeability of the BBB; moreover, other vascular players, including endothelin-1, also mediate artery inflammation. As a consequence of the disruption of the BBB, a progressive neuroinflammatory response is produced that, added to the astrogliosis, eventually triggers neuronal degeneration (possibly responsible for cognitive deterioration). Recently, new molecules have been proposed as early biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction that can constitute new therapeutic targets as well as early diagnostic and prognostic markers for AD.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the main neurodegenerative disease leading to dementia and cognitive impairment in the elderly worldwide. The classic pathophysiological hallmarks of AD are extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau tangles, which eventually lead to the impairment of cognitive functions. These features progress slowly and are asymptomatic in the first stages of the disease. In fact, this fact hinders an acute premortem diagnosis if not aided by biological markers, as AD symptomatology may share similarities with other causes of dementia. Besides cellular alterations, AD is also characterized by the presence of several vascular alterations, including small infarcts, or lacunes, due to the occlusion of branches of cerebral arteries, increases in the number of atrophic vessels and amount of vascular tortuosity (abnormal twists and turns in vessels), and decreases in microvascular density and length. Indeed, such brain vascular-associated alterations underlie many pathophysiological mechanisms of AD . Accordingly, the two-hit vascular hypothesis points at the initial damage in cerebral vasculature (hit one) as the inducer of the accumulation of β-amyloid in the brain (hit two) . Remarkably, cerebral blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage and microbleeds are associated with cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD, which opens the door to search for new biomarkers allowing for the diagnosis of AD before symptoms start. Importantly, many recent studies assessed the relationship between AD and stroke, another vascular-related neurological disease with a worldwide impact . In this regard, a meta-analysis revealed that all stroke subtypes significantly increase the risk of developing AD ; and, more recently, that several differentially expressed genes and cellular pathways are shared by both stroke and AD . Furthermore, our group has highlighted that higher numbers of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) within the first week following stroke have a positive impact on functional outcome , and several studies point to EPCs as a beneficial target for AD . Altogether, EPCs may offer a new target to find a treatment for AD based on their recent molecular and genetic connections. In this review, we will focus on vascular-related biomarkers with the potential to become indicators of either the beginning and/or progression of AD; therefore, we will review the latest evidence regarding the relationship between vascular damage and AD, as well as how this interconnection has an impact on AD pathophysiology.",

Evidence from post-mortem AD brains show a feasible connection between vascular alterations and AD pathophysiology, which puts endothelial dysfunctions under the AD field spotlight to search for new therapeutic targets and/or disease-evolution biomarkers. Several biomarkers for vascular inflammation (e.g., OPN and CAMs) and vascular damage (e.g., albumin and MMPs) are being deeply studied in the AD field. Likewise, different growth factors (e.g., VEGF) and the analysis of cells and microparticles are rising in the AD forefront; however, many cellular mechanisms are not fully understood and, hence, more studies are still needed to elucidate the underlying pathways. Overall, and despite controversy, endothelial damage associated with AD is undeniable at the structural level; therefore, this is an emerging field that demands more research to fully understand and decipher the mechanisms underlying the different connections between vessels, endothelial cells, and AD. In the future, AD-associated vascular changes have an enormous potential for revealing new therapeutic targets and/or biomarkers allowing the early diagnosis of AD."

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that imposes a significant burden on individuals, families, and society. With the aging global population, the prevalence of AD is continuously increasing. Despite landmark antibody approval, there remain side effects such as brain swelling and hemorrhage, highlighting the urgent need for effective treatments1–3. In recent years, the integration of bioinformatics with high-throughput omics data has opened up new avenues for understanding this disease and identifying novel therapeutic targets4–7. In this study, we employed several bioinformatics methods, including the identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), Mfuzz clustering and Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNA-seq). Furthermore, we integrated these approaches with machine learning algorithms, such as Lasso regression, SVM-RFE, and Random Forest, to screen potential therapeutic targets for AD. This study aims to utilize a comprehensive bioinformatics approach to discover new treatment targets for AD. DEG analysis is employed in this study to identify genes that exhibit significant differential expression between AD patients and healthy controls8. This approach allows for the identification of candidate genes that may play a crucial role in AD pathogenesis. WGCNA is a widely used method that groups genes with similar expression patterns into modules9,10. By analyzing the co-expression networks, WGCNA can help identify key modules and hub genes that are highly associated with AD. Furthermore, MFuzz clustering is a fuzzy clustering technique specifically designed for the analysis of gene expression data. Unlike traditional methods that assign each data point to a single cluster, MFuzz allows a data point to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. This flexibility is particularly beneficial in biological studies where gene expression may fluctuate under different conditions. MFuzz determines the fuzzy membership of genes within clusters based on their expression patterns, utilizing a fuzzy c-means algorithm. This method effectively identifies clusters of genes with similar expression profiles, even if their absolute expression levels may differ11–13. Ultimately, it can be employed to analyze gene expression data, enabling the identification of gene clusters that share similar expression patterns and the discovery of genes linked to the pathological progression of AD. ScRNA-seq is a powerful technology that enables the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level, elucidating distinctions in brain cells between AD patients and healthy individuals14,15. Integrating these different bioinformatics approaches provides a holistic view of the genes and pathways involved in AD, enabling the identification of potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by individual methods. To enhance the screening process and prioritize the most relevant genes, machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and the random forest (RF) model are employed16–18. These algorithms utilize various statistical and computational techniques to identify the most informative variables and create predictive models. By incorporating these algorithms into the analysis pipeline, we can optimize the identification of AD-related genes and increase the accuracy of potential therapeutic target prediction. Overall, this study presents a comprehensive and systematic approach that integrates multiple bioinformatics methods and machine learning algorithms to identify potential therapeutic targets for AD. By harnessing the power of these techniques, we aim to contribute to the development of effective treatments for this devastating disease.",
        "conclusion": "AD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that poses a significant challenge to modern medicine. Through the application of bioinformatics methods including DEGs, WGCNA, Mfuzz, scRNA-seq, and machine learning in our research, we have potentially uncovered new therapeutic targets for this disease. This investigation identified 3432 DEGs. The GSEA analysis of these DEGs revealed the upregulation of Notch signaling pathway, allograft rejection, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway in AD patients, alongside the downregulation of endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, synaptic vesicle cycle, nicotine addiction, collecting duct acid secretion, and the citrate cycle. The Notch signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the development of neural cell populations in the brain, particularly in the normal process of neurodevelopment. Mutations in PSEN1 may disrupt the signaling pathway, thereby impacting the progression of AD, especially in the majority of familial AD30,31. Additionally, the Notch signaling pathway may govern the proliferation of astrocytes, thus influencing neuroinflammation32. Upregulation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway indicates chronic neuroinflammation, glial activation, and increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators, which can contribute to amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in AD33–36. C-abl is a key pathogenic factor in chronic myeloid leukemia, and it is also activated in the brains of AD patients. Inhibiting the activation of c-Abl can improve cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model37. Some medications used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, such as imatinib and dasatinib, can regulate the pathological physiological states associated with various diseases affecting the brain and spinal cord, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury38,39. Conversely, the downregulation of endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, synaptic vesicle cycle, nicotine addiction, collecting duct acid secretion, and the citrate cycle in AD patients signifies disruptions in critical cellular functions essential for neuronal signaling, neurotransmission, blood–brain barrier function, and cellular metabolism, and may also involve Aβ aggregation, neuroinflammation, or neuronal damage40–49. Cluster 2 in the Mfuzz analysis consists of 3424 genes closely associated with the pathological progression of AD. DO and KEGG analyses confirm that the genes in Cluster 2 are primarily involved in pathways of neurodegeneration—multiple diseases and Alzheimer’s disease. WGCNA identified a total of 6797 genes and the intersection of the three methods yielded 809 disease-related genes. Functional analysis of these disease genes indicates their association with various BP and CC, including synapse organization, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and regulation of trans-synaptic signaling. These genes are enriched in KEGG pathways related to neurodegeneration of multiple diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Additionally, the DO enrichment analysis identified key targets primarily involved in pervasive developmental disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and electroclinical syndrome. Altogether, these results indicate a high correlation between the identified disease genes and AD. Additionally, 39 disease genes are located in KEGG pathway of Alzheimer’s disease. The use of SVM-RFE, Random Forest, and LASSO algorithms led to the identification of five hub genes: PLCB1, NDUFAB1, KRAS, ATP2A2, and CALM3. PLCB1, which encodes for phospholipase C beta 1, is a key enzyme involved in the signal transduction pathway, regulating various cellular functions including neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity50,51. Dysregulation of PLCB1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease through its impact on amyloid beta metabolism, neuronal hyperexcitability, proliferation of neuronal cells and synaptic dysfunction52,53. NDUFAB1 is a component of the mitochondrial complex I, which is essential for electron transport and ATP synthesis54. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-known feature of AD, and defects in complex I have been associated with increased oxidative stress, another contributor to AD55–57. KRAS is a well-known oncogene commonly linked to cancer. Interestingly, it is also associated with rare neurodevelopmental intellectual disabilities. Studies suggest that KRAS mutations impact the development and function of GABAergic inhibitory neurons, potentially causing behavioral deficits in mice58,59. ATP2A2 encodes SERCA2, which plays a critical role in maintaining calcium homeostasis60. Proper calcium homeostasis is important for neuronal function, and disruptions in calcium signaling have been implicated in AD. Altered expression or function of SERCA2 could thus influence the progression of AD through effects on calcium equilibrium within cells61,62. CALM3 is one of the genes encoding calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein that plays a key role in translating calcium signals into cellular responses63. Calmodulin is involved in various cellular processes, including many that are altered in AD, such as inflammation, hippocampal apoptosis, and mitochondrial apoptosis. Alterations in calmodulin-mediated signaling could contribute to the neuropathological changes observed in AD64,65. The single gene GSEA analysis of the five hub genes revealed associations with pathways including Notch signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, Hedgehog signaling pathway and Synaptic vesicle cycle, generally aligning with the GSEA analysis of the DEGs. AD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, and alterations in immune cell populations are thought to play an important role in its pathogenesis66. The increase in central memory CD8 T cells, effector memory CD8 T cells, activated B cells, immature B cells, natural killer cells, CD56dim natural killer cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, natural killer T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, mast cells, and neutrophils can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the immune system may be activated in response to the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These abnormal protein aggregates can trigger an inflammatory response, leading to the recruitment and activation of immune cells66. For example, natural killer cells and CD8 T cells may be involved in immune surveillance and clearance of damaged cells or abnormal proteins67–70. Immature B cells and activated B cells may be recruited to produce antibodies against amyloid beta71. Myeloid derived suppressor cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells may modulate the immune response and contribute to inflammation72. Mast cells and neutrophils can release inflammatory mediators that further exacerbate the immune response73–75. On the other hand, the decrease in effector memory CD4 T cells and memory B cells may be due to dysregulation of the immune system76,77. In AD, the upregulation of most immune cell subsets may be due to the impact of chronic inflammation in the brain or other pathological processes affecting the function and survival of these cells66. Furthermore, a robust correlation exists between hub genes and the majority of altered immune cells, implying that inflammatory components may have a vital role in the progression of AD, and hub genes may possess a novel regulatory function in immune response. The scRNA-seq analysis revealed distinct cell subtypes and the expression patterns of hub genes in the context of AD. Through the utilization of UMAP plots, 26 cell clusters were identified, and cell types were assigned based on established marker genes. This classification unveiled essential cell types including oligodendrocytes, neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. The bar graph effectively depicts the alterations in cell proportions between the AD and control group samples, providing a clear visual representation of the changes observed. Notably, a significant decrease in neuronal proportion was observed in the AD group, while there were marked increases in microglial and astrocytic proportions compared to the control group. This shift in cell type proportions suggests potential alterations in cellular composition that may influence the pathogenesis of AD. The accumulation of β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD hampers neural transmission, damages neurotransmitters, leading to neuronal death and diminished quantities66. Within the central nervous system, microglial cells, which are immune cells, can be activated by β-amyloid, causing them to aggregate around Aβ plaques and proliferate. Activated microglial cells release inflammatory factors, which may assist in clearing pathogenic substances like Aβ; however, excessive release can harm nearby neurons, exacerbating neuroinflammatory responses66,78. In the presence of Alzheimer’s pathology-induced neuronal degeneration or death, astrocytes become activated and multiply. These activated astrocytes secrete pro-inflammatory factors, initiating neuroinflammation and accelerating the progression of AD79. The relevant analysis shows that there is a positive correlation among five hub genes. Thus, a nomogram model for predicting AD risk was established. In the current two AD datasets, the AUC of the five hub genes are all greater than 0.7. Indicating that PLCB1, NDUFAB1, KRAS, ATP2A2, and CALM3 all exhibit good diagnostic value. Among these, PLCB1 exhibits the highest AUC, reaching 0.846 and 0.887 respectively. PLCB1 shows the strongest correlation with Braak stages and neurons in AD, especially with a correlation of 0.93 to neurons. Interestingly, the expression level of PLCB1 in the human brain is significantly higher than in other tissues. Immunohistochemistry shows high expression of PLCB1 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal neurons. In conclusion, PLCB1 may have great potential in the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Three small molecular compounds, Noscapine, PX-316, and TAK-901, were screened as therapeutic targets for PLCB1. Noscapine, a phthalide isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from opium80, exhibits a range of effects, such as neuroprotection, vascular protection, modulation of axonal transport, attenuation of brain damage, anti-inflammatory characteristics, and alleviation of anxiety, offering potential benefits in tackling a range of neurological disorders81,82. Moreover, it has shown antioxidant properties that help combat oxidative stress linked to AD pathology83, and possesses the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier80, highlighting Noscapine’s promising potential as a pharmacological treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. PX-316 is a drug that can inhibit the Akt survival signal83, inhibiting Akt activity helps protect the survival of neurons, and may enhance resistance to AD-related pathology84. TAK-901, a potent inhibitor of Aurora B85, which could aid in the restoration of appropriate axonal transport of neuronal mitochondria, offering potential benefits in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases86. Research on their role in AD is still in the early stages, with the majority of published studies limited to in vitro or animal models. Further research is needed to elucidate their potential therapeutic effects for AD. In conclusion, our study has preliminarily screened five hub genes closely related to AD: PLCB1, NDUFAB1, KRAS, ATP2A2, and CALM3. The research indicates that PLCB1 may be a effective diagnostic and therapeutic target."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of dementia in the elderly. The disease has a high impact on individuals and their families and represents a growing public health and socio-economic burden. Despite this, there is no effective treatment options to cure or modify the disease progression, highlighting the need to identify new therapeutic targets. Synapse dysfunction and loss are early pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, correlate with cognitive decline and proceed with neuronal death. In the last years, the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) has emerged as a key regulator of synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. To this end, the ligase binds Cdh1, its main activator in the brain. However, inactivation of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome-Cdh1 complex triggers dendrite disruption, synapse loss and neurodegeneration, leading to memory and learning impairment. Interestingly, oligomerized amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, which is involved in Alzheimer's disease onset and progression, induces Cdh1 phosphorylation leading to anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome-Cdh1 complex disassembly and inactivation. This causes the aberrant accumulation of several anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome-Cdh1 targets in the damaged areas of Alzheimer's disease brains, including Rock2 and Cyclin B1. Here we review the function of anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome-Cdh1 dysregulation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, paying particular attention in the neurotoxicity induced by its molecular targets. Understanding the role of anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome-Cdh1-targeted substrates in Alzheimer's disease may be useful in the development of new effective disease-modifying treatments for this neurological disorder.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer Disease’s (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia in the adult, affecting around 35 million patients. The number of people with AD is growing rapidly and it is estimated that the number of patients with dementia will double in Europe and triple worldwide, by 2050 (Scheltens et al., 2021). Increasing prevalence coupled with a lack of effective treatments make this disease an important socio-economic problem for states and families (Cummings 2021). The irreversible brain damage is the result of neurodegeneration in selective brain areas, primarily hippocampus and cortex, underlying the gradual decline of cognitive function and daily living activities (Mrdjen et al., 2019). The two major histopathological hallmarks of AD are protein aggregates of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide forming extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Scheltens et al., 2021). Although senile plaques are not correlated with cognitive decline, Aβ oligomers formed during the peptide aggregation are synaptotoxic and trigger disease progression (Ferreira et al., 2015). The accumulation of these oligomers starts years before AD clinical symptoms (Panza et al., 2019). In this context, synaptic plasticity impairment is an early pathological event in AD and strongly correlates with the cognitive status of the patient. Moreover, synaptic dysfunction and loss usually arises in prodromal or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages of the AD continuum. This synaptic loss is followed by neurodegeneration and cognitive decline progression in later stages of the disease (Jackson et al., 2019; Karisetty et al., 2020). Aβ aggregates trigger synaptic dysfunction mainly through excitotoxicity via different mechanisms, including Ca2+ influx into the neurons, internalization, and removal of glutamate receptors (GluRs), mitochondrial dysfunction, energy deficit, and oxidative/nitrosative stress, all leading to synaptic plasticity disruption and neurodegeneration. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are the two primary forms of synaptic plasticity, are altered in AD (Zhang et al., 2022). The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) controls protein homeostasis, which is essential for key cellular proccesses, including cell cycle, cell survival, metabolism, inflammation, and synaptic plasticity, among others (Dantuma and Bott 2014; Cheng et al., 2018). The role of the UPS on synaptic plasticity has been confirmed by the fact that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of the UPS causes defects in the LTP and LTP-related behaviour (Jiang et al., 1998; Fonseca et al., 2006). Impaired UPS has been linked with both the early and late stages of AD. Specifically, Cdh1, the main activator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) in neurons, is a key regulator of synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival (Almeida 2012; Huang and Bonni 2016; Bobo-Jimenez et al., 2017). Cdh1 deficiency triggers APC/C inactivation leading to synapse loss, neurodegeneration and memory and learning impairment (Gieffers et al., 1999; Almeida et al., 2005). Moreover, APC/C-Cdh1 activity is impaired in AD models and APC/C-Cdh1 targets accumulate in damaged areas of AD brains (Fuchsberger et al., 2017), which evidence an association between APC/C-Cdh1 activity and AD pathology. Then, the APC/C-Cdh1 signalling pathway may provide novel therapeutic strategies to modify AD progression.",
        "conclusion": "Over the past decade, huge efforts have been made to find suitable targets for the treatment of AD. Most of the attempts have tried to tackle Aβ. However, none of the Aβ-based therapies have been effective so far, with the controversial exception of the FDA approved aducanumab (Cummings et al., 2022). A refocusing approach should be made addressing new targets further downstream of Aβ accumulation in the AD pathology. Through Cdh1 activation, the APC/C complex maintains synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, which is essential for brain functioning and healthy aging. APC/C inactivation has been found in AD models, Cdh1 targets being accumulated in the brain of AD patients, which promote neurodegeneration and cognitive decline through several mechanisms including cell cycle machinery activation, excitotoxicity, metabolism impairment, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction (Figure 2), rendering this pathway as a suitable candidate to develop drugs for AD treatment. Understanding the APC/C-Cdh1 signalling pathway in AD might be important to identify new molecular targets for the development of effective disease-modifying treatments for this neurological disorder."

        "abstract": "Ion channels play an integral role in the normal functioning of the brain. They regulate neuronal electrical properties like synaptic activity, generation of action potentials, maintenance of resting membrane potential and neuronal plasticity, and modulate the physiology of non-neuronal cells like astrocytes and microglia. Dysregulation of ionic homeostasis and channelopathies are associated with various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several families of ion channels are associated with AD pathophysiology and progression. In this review, we outline the current research centered around ion channel dysregulation during AD and discuss briefly the possibility of using ion channels as therapeutic targets.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, multifactorial and identified by the accumulation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Selkoe 1991). Improper cleavage of APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) by a complex family of enzymes consisting of γ-secretase and ß-secretase leads to the formation of neurotoxic Aß oligomers (Masters et al. 2015). On the other hand, hyperphosphorylated tau protein has been shown to accumulate intracellularly in neurons as tangles, another hallmark of AD. A third factor that has been linked to AD is the APOE gene, such that APOE4 carriers have been shown to increase AD risk and decrease Aß clearance. All these three main elements are linked with the neurotoxicity of AD. Although late stages of AD manifest excessive neuronal loss and decreased function, leading to cognitive decline and memory impairment, the early stages exhibit neuronal hyperexcitability, leading to metabolic stress and neuronal death, translating to cognitive decline at later stages of the disease (Holtzman 2001; Masters et al. 2015). Beyond the neuronal perspective of AD, astrocytes and microglia are also involved in the pathophysiology of AD (Kim et al. 2024). Astrocytes play an important role in maintaining homeostasis by uptaking neurotransmitters and, re-packing them into vesicles and sending them back to the neurons for the subsequent transmission. Disruption of this mechanism is hypothesized to be one of the earliest defects during AD (Kim et al. 2024; Morquette et al. 2015; Siracusa et al. 2019). Recently, neuroinflammation in AD has been observed in several studies involving AD patients and mouse models, such that activated microglia, immunoglobulins, and complement components were found to be closely associated with Aβ deposits in brains from AD patients and mouse models. Ion channels play a crucial role in maintaining normal physiology in the CNS in various processes such as action potential generation, neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, membrane potential, memory formation, and more (Shah et al. 2010; Südhof 2012). In various neurological diseases, ion channel dysregulation plays a vital role in the pathophysiology and is an attractive therapeutic target (Chen & Majdi 2009; Li & Lester 2006; Pietrobon 2002; Wang et al. 2022). In AD, ion channel pathophysiology also plays an important role, and this review will encompass the current literature on ion channel pathophysiology in AD (Wang et al. 2022).",
        "conclusion": "In this review, we outline the roles that different ion channels play in AD pathology and progression (Fig. 1). With some of the ion channels, contradictory results exist, and it will be important to investigate the mechanisms that lead to such behavior. The same ion channel might have varying and potentially opposite effects depending on the brain region and neuronal cell type and non-neuronal cell type in the brain (Table 1). An understanding of the ion channel physiology in AD will provide insight into the various aspects of the disease and can potentially uncover therapeutic targets early in the disease. Since AD is a highly debilitating progressive neurodegenerative disease, early interventions will not only help in slowing progression but may also reverse the disease. Therefore, it is important to target the ion channels that can act as disease-modifying therapies at the early stages of AD.Fig. 1Ion Channel Dysregulation in AD.

Lecanemab (Leqembi®) and aducanumab (Aduhelm® are two anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (MABs) that have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD. Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies have disease-modifying abilities that can slow down clinical decline. However, the reduction in clinical decline is modest at about 30% (Cummings et al. 2023), indicating that further research is required for the development of effective therapies. Receptor-based drugs like FDA-approved memantine, which act on NMDA receptors, have been shown to be efficacious in slowing the progression of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer’s disease (Lipton, Curr Drug Targets 2007; Ghatak et al., Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology 2021). However, their efficacy early on in the disease is low. Therefore, an understanding of ion channels affecting early AD is important."

        "title": "Gut microbiota metabolites: potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease?",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function, which significantly increases pain and social burden. However, few therapeutic interventions are effective in preventing or mitigating the progression of AD. An increasing number of recent studies support the hypothesis that the gut microbiome and its metabolites may be associated with upstream regulators of AD pathology. METHODS: In this review, we comprehensively explore the potential mechanisms and currently available interventions targeting the microbiome for the improvement of AD. Our discussion is structured around modern research advancements in AD, the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, the multi-target regulatory effects of microbial metabolites on AD, and therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating gut microbiota to manage AD. RESULTS: The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD through continuous bidirectional communication via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Among these, microbial metabolites such as lipids, amino acids, bile acids and neurotransmitters, especially sphingolipids and phospholipids, may serve as central components of the gut-brain axis, regulating AD-related pathogenic mechanisms including β-amyloid metabolism, Tau protein phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Additionally, interventions such as probiotic administration, fecal microbiota transplantation, and antibiotic use have also provided evidence supporting the association between gut microbiota and AD. At the same time, we propose an innovative strategy for treating AD: a healthy lifestyle combined with targeted probiotics and other potential therapeutic interventions, aiming to restore intestinal ecology and microbiota balance. CONCLUSION: Despite previous efforts, the molecular mechanisms by which gut microbes act on AD have yet to be fully described. However, intestinal microorganisms may become an essential target for connecting the gut-brain axis and improving the symptoms of AD. At the same time, it requires joint exploration by multiple centers and multiple disciplines.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent type of dementia. It is known for causing gradual memory decline, cognitive and behavioral impairments, and sleep rhythm disturbances (Knopman et al., 2021). These symptoms significantly deteriorate the quality of life for patients and impose substantial societal burdens. According to statistics, in 2023, approximately 6.7 million individuals aged 65 and older in the United States were diagnosed with AD (Alzheimer’s disease facts and figures, 2023; Rajan et al., 2021). It is projected that by 2060, this number will increase to 13.8 million, making it the fifth leading cause of death in the country (Alzheimer’s disease facts and figures, 2023). Additionally, it is estimated that by 2050, the global number of dementia patients will reach 152 million (GBD 2019 Dementia Forecasting Collaborators, 2022). Despite the fact that the pathogenesis of AD is not completely understood, several factors influencing its progression have been identified. Among these factors, there has been a growing focus in recent years on the gut microbiome and its relationship with the brain. The gut microbiome consists of a complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal ecosystem, containing bacteria, fungi and viruses (Brown et al., 2023; Valdes et al., 2018). The gut microbiome, often referred to as the “second brain,” plays a role in digestion, absorption, and immune regulation while also participating in the gut-brain axis activities that influence cognition and memory. The gut microbiome communicate with the brain through neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways (Morais et al., 2021), collectively known as the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA) (Zhou et al., 2024). Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiome play an important role in the development and progression of AD (Chen et al., 2024). Intestinal flora imbalance may occur in the prodromal stage of AD, suggesting that identifying biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment could facilitate early detection and timely treatment of AD (Li et al., 2019). Does the gut microbiome change during subjective cognitive decline (pre-dementia)? A cohort study found a significant reduction in the abundance of the anti-inflammatory genus Faecalibacterium in the gut microbiota of patients with subjective cognitive decline, which was correlated with positive amyloid PET results (Sheng et al., 2021). This suggests that changes in microbial diversity and abundance are related to cognitive function, consistent with the results of another study by Sheng et al. (2022). Additionally, recent research has shown that antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis in the Callithrix jacchus model leads to alterations in gut-brain axis communication mediators, which influence the cognitive and social abilities of these marmosets (Hayer et al., 2024). With the advancement of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, gut microbiome and their metabolites have come into focus and may become potential therapeutic targets for AD in the future (Kuhn et al., 2019; Bharti and Grimm, 2021). Therefore, further investigation into the multi-target regulatory mechanisms of gut microbial metabolites in AD and their potential as therapeutic targets is crucial for uncovering the disease’s pathogenesis and developing innovative treatment strategies. In recent years, as research on AD has deepened, scientists have increasingly recognized the critical role of the gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis. Based on this understanding, this review will first summarize the recent advancements in AD research, then analyze the specific mechanisms of bidirectional communication in the gut-brain axis, particularly the multifaceted regulatory roles of gut metabolites in AD, and finally explore innovative therapeutic strategies targeting gut microbiota for AD management.",
        "conclusion": "In recent years, a growing body of research has highlighted the critical role of gut microbiota and their metabolites in the pathogenesis of AD. In this review, we comprehensively explore the multiple roles of gut microbial metabolites in AD, revealing how these metabolites influence the complex processes of neurodegeneration through the MGBA. Current research demonstrates that metabolites such as lipids, amino acids, and bile acids play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Specifically, they are critical in the regulation of Aβ metabolism and Tau protein phosphorylation, and may serve as key biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring of AD. However, despite the increasing understanding of these metabolites, their precise effects at different stages of AD remain unclear, presenting significant opportunities for future research. Compared to previous studies, this paper further elucidates the potential of microbial metabolites in regulating various pathogenic mechanisms via the MGBA. For instance, SCFAs have the potential to directly impact the central nervous system by maintaining BBB integrity, inhibiting neuroinflammation, and enhancing synaptic plasticity, demonstrating their potential in AD therapy. Additionally, BAs regulate neuroprotection and metabolic processes through pathways such as FXR and TGR5. However, their impact on AD remains incompletely understood, warranting further exploration of these molecular mechanisms in future studies. However, the current research presents significant limitations. Firstly, although significant progress has been made in animal and in vitro studies, there is a lack of large-scale, systematic human clinical studies. The considerable variability in gut microbiota across individuals may result in low comparability between different study outcomes. Secondly, existing studies predominantly focus on the effects of individual metabolites, often overlooking the potential complex interactions between these metabolites. Therefore, future research should place greater emphasis on the dynamic interactions between microbial metabolites and the host nervous system, exploring their specific roles across different pathological stages. Although research is still evolving, gut microbial metabolites have demonstrated significant potential as therapeutic targets for AD. Based on current research, we propose an innovative strategy for treating AD: long-term dietary and lifestyle adjustments, combined with probiotics, antibiotics, or gut microbiota transplantation, aimed at restoring the balance of the gut microbiome and metabolites. However, translating these research findings into clinical applications requires overcoming several challenges, including elucidating the specific mechanisms of gut microbial metabolites in AD, optimizing intervention strategies, and ensuring the safety and efficacy of clinical applications. With the ongoing advancements in metagenomics, metabolomics, and systems biology, we are likely to further unravel the complex mechanisms of the gut-brain axis and develop more precise and effective therapeutic approaches."

        "abstract": "There is an urgent need for effective disease-modifying therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-the most prevalent cause of dementia with a profound socioeconomic burden. Most clinical trials targeting the classical hallmarks of this disease-β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles-failed, showed discrete clinical effects, or were accompanied by concerning side effects. There has been an ongoing search for novel therapeutic targets. Neuroinflammation, now widely recognized as a hallmark of all neurodegenerative diseases, has been proven to be a major contributor to AD pathology. Here, we summarize the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of AD and discuss potential targets such as microglia, TREM2, the complement system, inflammasomes, and cytosolic DNA sensors. We also present an overview of ongoing studies targeting specific innate immune system components, highlighting the progress in this field of drug research while bringing attention to the delicate nature of innate immune modulations in AD.",

        "introduction": "Due to advances in healthcare and increased longevity, societies of all industrialized and non-industrialized countries are seeing a significant increase in the prevalence of common neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These devastating disorders represent the biggest challenge and an immense economic burden for all health systems around the world. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive neuronal loss that leads to a decline in memory and other cognitive functions, i.e., dementia, culminating in the loss of independence in activities of daily living. To illustrate the potential magnitude of AD’s impact, epidemiologists have estimated that the global prevalence of AD in people older than 65 years will rise to 150 million by 2050 . This alarming estimation shows the urgency to develop novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of this gigantic public health challenge. Histologically, AD is defined by two core neuropathological hallmarks: the accumulation of extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein . However, classical neuropathological features begin even decades before the first cognitive symptoms manifest . Additionally, the pre-pathological stages of AD are thought to be characterized by latent neuroinflammation , alterations in the blood–brain barrier , accelerated cellular senescence , and dysfunction of the glymphatic system . This cellular phase occurs alongside the processing and accumulation of Aβ aggregates. According to the current but debated hypothesis, Aβ triggers tau pathology. The neuroanatomical spread of misfolded tau species correlates tightly with the clinical progression of the disease . Innate immune activation and subsequent neuroinflammation occur early in the cellular phase and are present throughout the AD continuum. These processes are considered to be essential in the initiation and progression of the disease . Microglia, the main immune cells of the brain, are found to be activated in humans and animal models even before the deposition of Aβ plaques and the spread of tau pathology in cortical networks. These observations together with a body of scientific studies summarized in this review clearly show that early preclinical innate activation and neuroinflammatory responses from microglia and other cells must be investigated in more detail to develop effective preventive and disease-modifying therapies. In the following review, we summarized the role of microglia as the main actors in the innate immune responses of the brain and the pathogenesis of AD. We discuss several pathways related to innate activation in AD and potential targets such as microglia, TREM2, the complement system, inflammasomes, and cytosolic DNA sensors (Figure 1). We highlight novel promising compounds and interventions that are being explored experimentally and are paving the way in translational medicine and future clinical studies (Figure 2).",
        "conclusion": "Neuroinflammation is not only a mere contributor but can also be a driving force behind AD pathophysiology and progression. Several studies testing antibodies, inhibitors, agonists, and diets targeting neuroinflammation have brought hope for improved therapy in AD (Table 1). However, the complexity of immune interactions poses an important obstacle to address in drug research. Acute neuroinflammation is necessary for maintaining brain homeostasis while the sustained overactivation of the innate immune system can be a priming factor for disease development and exacerbate its progression. A great example of this are microglia, which are crucial in brain development, in maintaining homeostasis, and in the response to DAMPs/PAMPs, including the clearance of Aβ. However, their chronic activation leads to impaired Aβ removal, synapse engulfment, and neuronal damage, resulting in neurodegeneration. Thus, it is necessary to find the right balance of specific immune system components to avoid detrimental side effects. Moreover, it is important to consider the best time window and the administration routes as well as interactions with genetic and environmental factors to increase the probability of success in clinical studies. However, the intricacy of the immune system has also advantages as it presents multiple promising targets for therapeutic modification: from specific immune cell modulators, through pro-inflammatory cytokines to multiprotein complexes. Therefore, the further understanding of the innate immune system within the context of neurodegeneration should be the main focus as it provides new directions for medical intervention in AD."

        "title": "Genetic insights into drug targets for alzheimer's disease: integrative multi-omics analysis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The development of effective disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical unmet need. While Mendelian randomization (MR) has been leveraged to identify genetic variants to accelerate AD target discovery, previous studies have been limited by narrow phenotypic coverage, insufficient multiomics validation, and inadequate mechanistic exploration. This study aims to overcome these limitations via comprehensive MR to identify robust therapeutic targets. METHODS: We performed an integrative multiomics MR analysis leveraging over 50 genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets spanning AD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau), neuroimaging endophenotypes, cognitive traits, and risk factors. Blood/CSF/brain protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) from large-scale proteomics studies were analyzed to identify druggable targets. A rigorous validation cascade was subsequently performed: Bayesian colocalization was performed to assess whether the same variants are associated with the protein and other traits; summary-data-based MR was performed to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage; mediation analysis was performed to quantify biomarker-driven causal pathways; integrated analysis of multiomics (single-cell RNA-seq and proteome) data was performed to resolve cellular specificity, and (PPI) interaction networks were generated; phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) was performed across 679 traits to evaluate on-target side effects; and structure-based druggability screening was conducted. RESULTS: Proteome-wide MR analysis revealed 15 potential drug targets for AD; six of these targets (PILRA, GRN, ACE, TIMD3, TREM2) were validated as Tier 1 (highest-confidence targets with external validation and causal consistency). Mediation analysis revealed that IDUA reduced the risk of AD through Aβ42 and p-tau in the CSF, whereas Siglec-7/9 increased the risk of AD through p-tau in the CSF. Additional targets revealed associations with AD biomarkers, neuroimaging, and cognitive function. Single-cell analysis highlighted the enrichment of key microglial and astrocyte targets. PPI network analysis revealed interaction pathways between seven drug targets and four AD therapeutics, and druggability assessment revealed seven potential therapeutics. CONCLUSIONS: This study established a comprehensive AD target atlas, revealing mechanism-anchored targets that were validated across multiomics analyses and a clinically actionable framework integrating efficacy, biology, and safety profiling. Overall, these results advance AD drug discovery by revealing prioritized targets with causal biological support and providing a validated development roadmap.",

        "introduction": "The increasing global burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)—a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and pathological amyloid plaques/neurofibrillary tangles with complex multifactorial causes—poses a growing public health risk . However, no disease-modifying therapies have been shown to halt AD-associated cognitive decline. The number of people in the U.S. aged 65 and older with AD is expected to skyrocket in the future; by 2060, this number could reach 13.8 million . The recent conditional approval of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (e.g., lecanemab, aducanumab), which target amyloid plaques to promote their clearance, validates the principle of target-driven therapeutic development, and this approach provides a modest clinical benefit for some patients . However, the widespread application of these drugs is significantly hampered by their prohibitive costs, complex administration regimens, safety concerns (such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs)), and, crucially, their marginal efficacy in terms of slowing disease progression . These limitations collectively underscore the urgent and unmet need for mechanistically diverse, accessible, and efficacious therapeutic alternatives targeting pathways for biomarkers of AD. Human proteins serve as fundamental biological effectors and represent prime druggable targets for therapeutic intervention, as they directly mediate cellular processes and disease pathogenesis . The human proteome exhibits significant compartmentalization; proteins within the brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are inherently more closely related to the underlying pathology of central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, thus reflecting the local biochemical environment and disease processes. Conversely, the peripheral blood proteome may offer a less direct view of CNS-specific mechanisms, but it is considerably more accessible for large-scale screening, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring, and it remains invaluable for translational applications. Recent efforts to map protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) across blood, CSF, and brain tissues have provided unprecedented genetic leverage for causal inference via Mendelian randomization (MR), which is a method that harnesses germline genetic variations to minimize confounding and reverse causation . Although proteome-wide MR has revolutionized target discovery in neurodegenerative diseases, MR studies on AD have been superficial thus far . Prior investigations have narrowly focused on core AD clinical diagnosis as the primary endpoint, thus overlooking the critical opportunity to explore causal links to the rich landscape of preclinical AD biomarkers (e.g., Aβ and p-tau), detailed structural and functional neuroimaging endophenotypes (e.g., hippocampal atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, network connectivity), and the trajectories of specific cognitive domain impairments that define the clinical syndrome . To bridge this gap, the aim of this study was to conduct multiomics MR analyses of AD by integrating data from over 50 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) spanning AD diagnosis, CSF biomarkers (Aβ/p-tau), structural neuroimaging, and cognitive domains. In addition to identifying therapeutic targets, we pioneered causal mediation models that elucidated biomarker-driven pathways, revealed target cellular hubs at single-cell resolution and performed systematic safety profiling. This comprehensive framework was designed to identify highly prioritized therapeutic targets with robust genetic evidence for causality, to provide a clear biological foundation in the context of the AD pathological cascade and to significantly reduce the risk of failure in costly clinical development owing to efficacy or safety issues.",
        "conclusion": "Identifying possible mechanisms for drug targets in AD is a major goal of genetic research. We performed a large-scale and multiomics MR analysis of AD and its associated characteristics. We identified 15 candidate drug targets and categorized them into five tiers on the basis of the strength of genetic evidence, mechanistic evidence and validation across multiple datasets. To demonstrate this tiering strategy, we highlight established AD risk loci such as TREM2 (plasma) and APOE2 (brain), categorized as Tier 1 and 2, respectively, on the basis of consistent replication in two external datasets and strong mechanistic support, which were captured by our framework. Similarly, Siglec-7/9 (CSF), whose inclusion underscores a potential mechanism related to CSF p-tau, exhibited a significant risk effect on AD progression and strongly colocalized with AD phenotypes, and enrichment analyses further indicated its involvement in sialylated glycan and organic acid binding pathways. This finding demonstrates that our tiering strategy not only recapitulates well-established findings but also effectively identifies novel candidates for further investigation. Through comprehensive MR analysis of neuroimaging data, cognitive phenotypes, and biomarkers, we identified possible pathways associated with potential drug targets. The possible physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of IDUA (brain), APOE2 (brain), Siglec-7 (CSF) and Siglec-9 (CSF) on AD risk were further explored via mediation analysis. The methylation and transcription of these genes may be possible mechanisms for exploring the regulation of AD-related drug targets in the future. Additionally, our study revealed that the expression of these target genes was mostly enriched in microglia and astrocytes. These genetically predicted druggable targets may be associated with potential risks of nonepithelial cancer of the skin, retinal detachment, and metabolism-related diseases. APOE isoforms are associated with several AD-related phenotypes, such as lipid risk factors and APP processing, which can be used to draw inferences on how it can be approached as a potential druggable target . Our integrated proteomic MR analysis revealed that APOE2 expression in brain tissue exerts widespread beneficial effects across multiple phenotypes, including hippocampal volume, cingulum-hippocampus MD values, global structural connectivity, and default mode network integrity. The APOE2 locus colocalized with AD risk signals—a finding that is consistently supported by multiple genomic databases—confirming its high priority as a therapeutic target. Mediation analysis further indicated that APOE2 may ameliorate AD risk and preserve the integrity of the hippocampal cingulate bundle partly by elevating CSF Aβ42 levels. From a mechanistic perspective, APOE2 may confer protection against AD through multifaceted biological pathways beyond amyloid clearance . In terms of lipid metabolism, APOE2 enhances lipid transport and cholesterol homeostasis, supporting synaptic integrity and neuronal membrane stability . Its favorable lipid-binding properties facilitate efficient clearance of cytotoxic lipids and reduce lipid peroxidation, thereby attenuating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress . With respect to immunomodulation, APOE2 appears to suppress proinflammatory pathways—particularly through interactions with IL1B—modulating microglial activation and shifting microglia toward a phagocytic, anti-inflammatory phenotype . This effect may enhance Aβ clearance and reduce tau hyperphosphorylation. PPI analyses revealed that APOE2 engages with key players in AD pathogenesis, including APP, ACHE, BCHE, IL1B, NOX4, and NOS1. These interactions suggest the involvement of amyloid precursor protein processing, cholinergic signaling, oxidative stress regulation, and neuroinflammatory cascades. Specifically, connections with NOX4 and NOS1 play a role in mitigating reactive oxygen species production and endothelial dysfunction, further supporting cerebrovascular health . Taken together, these findings position APOE2 as a multilevel protective mediator in AD, influencing amyloid pathology, lipid homeostasis, neuroimmune regulation, and redox balance. The Siglec receptors are emerging as potential drug targets in AD, as they influence neuroinflammation, immune surveillance, and metabolic reprogramming. Previous proteomic studies have shown that, as a subtype of the Siglec receptor, Siglec-3 has the potential to be an AD-related drug target protein . From an immunological perspective, Siglec receptors act as checkpoint modulators that fine-tune neuroinflammatory responses. Siglec-3 promotes pro-inflammatory microglial activation, potentially accelerating Aβ accumulation and impairing phagocytosis . Its interaction with IL1B, as revealed by PPI analysis, suggests a role in amplifying neuroinflammation through cytokine signaling. Meanwhile, Siglec-7 and Siglec-9—expressed on NK cells and microglia—may suppress immune surveillance via sialic acid-mediated inhibitory signaling . This dampens NK cell cytotoxicity and microglial clearance of pathological proteins and senescent cells, facilitating p-tau propagation and synaptic damage. Metabolically, Siglec receptors engage in sialic acid-dependent metabolic reprogramming of immune cells . By binding to sialylated glycans on neuronal or glial surfaces, Siglecs may alter energy metabolism and mitochondrial function in microglia, shifting them toward a dysfunctional phenotype that favors tau hyperphosphorylation and oxidative stress . Although currently classified as Tier 3 targets, Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 support a multipronged disease-modifying strategy for AD therapy through their involvement in innate immune regulation and tau pathology. These findings extend the previous associations of Siglec-3 with AD by identifying Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 as potential immunomodulatory candidates, suggesting a broader role of Siglec signaling in tau propagation. Our results suggest that IDUA may reduce the risk of AD by modulating CSF levels of Aβ42 and p-tau through its role in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) catabolism and lysosomal function. Unlike well-established AD risk genes, IDUA represents a novel association. Its involvement in GAG catabolism and lysosomal function provides a mechanistic link to Aβ and tau accumulation that has not been systematically explored in human genetic studies. Defects in IDUA cause mucopolysaccharidosis, and notably, the accumulation of Aβ and p-tau has been observed in mouse models of this disorder , suggesting a plausible mechanistic link between impaired GAG degradation and AD-related proteopathy. IDUA may influence AD pathogenesis through several pathways. By facilitating the breakdown of GAGs such as heparan sulfate—which is known to promote Aβ aggregation and tau phosphorylation—IDUA can reduce the burden of pathological protein accumulation . Additionally, by maintaining lysosomal function and autophagic flux, IDUA may increase the clearance of misfolded proteins and decrease neuroinflammation . Improved lysosomal efficiency might also mitigate aberrant microglial and astrocyte activation, thereby contributing to preserved neuronal integrity. Although IDUA is currently classified as a Tier 4 target because of insufficient replication across databases, its biological relevance to protein clearance pathways and lysosomal function warrants further investigation. Our study revealed that PILRA, TIMD3, OMGP, and ACADV are druggable protein targets identified from plasma proteomic analyses, which collectively highlight diverse pathogenic pathways spanning viral response, protein clearance, and lipid metabolism for potential therapeutic intervention in AD. We found that genetically predicted higher levels of the two soluble isoforms of PILRA (deltaTM and M14) in plasma were associated with a lower risk of AD. Mechanistically, PILRA may confer protection by limiting HSV-1 viral entry through reduced interaction with viral glycoprotein D, thereby attenuating neuroinflammation and Aβ accumulation triggered by herpesviral infection . TIMD3, which binds to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells and interacts with amyloid precursor protein, may help regulate the clearance of cellular debris and modulate amyloidogenic processing . OMGP, an oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein enriched in the CNS, was suggestively protective against AD and associated with improved reaction time, highlighting its potential role in preserving white matter integrity and cognitive processing speed . Conversely, elevated plasma ACADV levels correlated with worsened cognitive performance, possibly through disruptions in fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial energy metabolism, leading to impaired neuronal function. Several plasma targets (PILRA, ACE, TREM2, BIN1, and GRN) have been previously reported in MR studies, strengthening their credibility . These findings were extended by text mining: ACE may coregulate pathways with APOE and ACHE; BIN1 and TREM2 are strongly tied to amyloid plaque accumulation; and GRN supports lysosomal function and Notch signaling, facilitating the clearance of misfolded proteins . We observed that higher plasma TREM2 levels were associated with a delayed age at onset of AD, potentially reflecting its role in enhancing microglial phagocytosis and promoting amyloid clearance. Tier assignment highlights robust targets such as PILRA with antiviral mechanisms, whereas tentative targets such as BIN1 are supported by weaker colocalization evidence. Collectively, these results highlight cell type-specific mechanisms—spanning viral response, lipid metabolism, myelination, and protein clearance—through which these candidates may influence AD risk. While recent proteomic studies have expanded the list of potential drug targets , our study stands apart by linking each target to causal genetic pathways and assessing their druggability potential. For instance, the analysis of APOE2 demonstrated how our integrative framework can elucidate the underlying mechanisms of genetic protection against AD. Our study further revealed that APOE2 in brain tissue may confer protection by increasing CSF Aβ42 levels, thereby reducing the genetic risk of AD and improving neuroimaging metrics. Our findings also suggest that APOE2 is potentially coexpressed with the ACHE target of donepezil and the APP target of lucanemab and aducanemab, highlighting its promising druggability potential and offering specific mechanistic insights for drug development. This approach ensures that drug targets are not only identified but also mechanistically understood, making them more suitable for therapeutic intervention. Recent work by Ali et al. prioritized candidate genes on the basis of CSF proteomic profiling, providing direct evidence of protein alterations in the CNS . In contrast, our integrative framework combined proteogenomic causal inference and MR across plasma, CSF, and brain pQTLs, alongside neuroimaging and cognitive data. Our framework successfully recapitulates well-established AD-associated proteins such as APOE and TREM2 while revealing novel candidates, including Siglec-7, Siglec-9, and IDUA. These findings not only extend previous proteomic observations but also provide complementary mechanistic insights into AD pathophysiology, highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention. These complementary perspectives highlight the need to integrate diverse proteomic strategies to comprehensively map AD biology and therapeutic opportunities. Despite the inherent trade-off between resolution and robustness, proteomic MR capitalizes on existing large-scale GWAS resources and thereby circumvents additional experimental costs. More importantly, it enables discovery in settings where sample size cannot be feasibly expanded, such as rare diseases or hard-to-measure phenotypes, offering insights that traditional large-scale studies are unlikely to achieve . By combining multitrait data, tissue-specific pQTLs, and annotations, proteomic MR improves the detection of causal signals beyond the reach of GWAS or proteomics alone . Evidence increasingly shows that therapeutic targets supported by human genetics are more likely to succeed in clinical development . Proteomic MR has already contributed to this process by accelerating target prioritization and validation across diverse disease areas, with several findings subsequently corroborated in independent cohorts and clinical studies, underscoring its translational value from genetic discovery to clinically actionable therapies . We explored protein targets for genetic prediction of AD in terms of a wide range of cognition-related phenotypes, which provides researchers with a broad range of associations with AD-related mechanisms. Our tiered framework provides a systematic way to prioritize candidate genes from GWAS loci while offering insights into AD biology. This layered strategy enables us not only to refine genetic associations but also to generate hypotheses for downstream functional studies . Despite being the large-scale and multiomics study of AD, it has several limitations. The lack of significant MR proteins in East Asians may stem from lower statistical power because of sample size differences, rather than biological differences, highlighting the need for further research. In addition, our study cannot precisely pinpoint individual pleiotropic variants (e.g., APOE2), which may affect the interpretation of our results, particularly for genes with known complex effects. Additionally, although MR provides stronger causal evidence than observational designs do, its inferential limits caution against claiming definitive causation. Because the GWASs used in this study were based on the lifetime risk of neurodegenerative disease at the population level, prospective studies tracking protein trajectories prior to diagnosis are needed. Furthermore, compared to previous proteome-wide MR studies, the tissue specificity and isoform associations of drug-target proteins may exert divergent effects on AD risk, as exemplified by PILRA and APOE. This underscores the imperative for future proteomic investigations to prioritize isoform-specific and tissue-resolved analyses in order to more accurately delineate causal pathways and identify promising therapeutic targets for AD. In summary, this multiomics proteomic MR study revealed 15 high-priority druggable targets for Alzheimer’s disease, with causal effects quantified across biomarkers, neuroimaging and cognitive functions. Crucially, we elucidated Aβ42- or p-tau-mediated pathogenic mechanisms for novel targets such as IDUA or Siglec-7/9. These findings offer a translatable blueprint for accelerating targeted therapy discovery, urging functional validation and clinical translation."

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a late‐onset, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that presents an immense and escalating burden on global health‐care systems, patients, and caregivers. 1 There is an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic interventions that can ameliorate these burdens. However, therapeutic development efforts are challenging given the complex, multifactorial nature of the disease. The interplay among genetic, lifestyle, and environmental risk factors over decades of life obscures which disease‐altered processes are optimal targets for effective interventions. 2 Systems‐level analyses, such as genome‐wide association studies (GWASs) and multi‐omic analyses have been used to address and catalog this complexity. These studies have yielded extensive lists of potential therapeutic targets. The largest GWASs implicate > 75 genomic loci in disease risk, 3 while the AD Knowledge Portal (agora.adknowledgeportal.org) currently lists > 900 targets nominated for therapeutic development based on the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease (AMP‐AD) nominations. 4 Effectively prioritizing these candidate targets remains a significant bottleneck. We have previously described an approach to integrate signatures of risk from AD case data. 5 This framework uses evidence from genetic association studies (e.g., GWAS, quantitative trait locus [QTL]) and from transcriptomic and proteomic assessment of differential expression in post mortem brain to score AD risk genome wide. This risk score is paired with the AD biological domains (biodomains), which enumerate the molecular features commonly implicated in the disease. The biodomains are functionalized via annotation of each with a set of largely unique Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Using these resources highlighted especially strong enrichment for disease risk among the synapse, immune response, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial metabolism domains. 5 We interrogated these risk‐enriched processes with orthogonal approaches to articulate interpretable hypotheses based on the systems‐level signatures of risk. We generated two exemplar hypotheses with this approach: (1) mitochondrial hypometabolism leads to an increased susceptibility to neurodegeneration, and (2) chronic neuroinflammation via overactivation of the innate immune response leads to neurodegenerative pathology in AD. These hypotheses are not novel and reflect consensus opinions from recent years regarding disease pathogenesis. 6 , 7 , 8 However, these hypotheses have been developed through systematic integration of disease risk signatures, and bioinformatic pipelines are used to identify candidate risk‐enriched targets related to each overarching hypothesis area. Each hypothesis emanates from a specific GO term (i.e., “mitochondrion” GO:0005739 and “innate immune response” GO:0045087), each having several hundred annotated risk genes. It is not clear from the available data which of the predicted driver genes are capable of affecting the targeted biology in appropriate cellular contexts. To resolve this question, we have developed a robust experimental system to screen candidate driver genes for those that are capable of affecting the biology under investigation (Figure 1). Given the nature of the exemplar hypotheses, we first used a microglial surrogate cell system to assess the impact of targeting the nominated genes. The genes were knocked down in the microglial surrogate lines and phenotypes relevant to mitochondrial function and immune response were assayed. Proteomic responses were also assessed after target knockdown. We integrated the results from cellular phenotype assays with proteomic responses to identify targets that both affect the phenotypes under investigation and impact associated biodomain terms in the proteomic results. Of the 29 candidate targets screened, we identify strong support for five targets—Ap2a2, Pdhb, Pdha1, Dlat, and Psmc3—that both significantly impact the cellular phenotypes screened and corresponding biodomain terms. Importantly, perturbation of each of these targets demonstrated the capacity to reverse the proteomic signatures associated with disease in these experiments. This work establishes a platform to filter and validate prioritized candidate therapeutic targets to those that have the greatest potential to impact disease‐relevant biology. This platform will be used by the Emory‐Sage‐Structural Genomics Consortium‐Jax Center Target Enablement to Accelerate Therapy Development for Alzheimer's Disease (TREAT‐AD) center to prioritize candidate targets for the development of additional target enabling packages by the center.",
        "conclusion": "Effective prioritization of candidate targets is challenging but essential for advancing novel AD therapeutics. We have developed an experimental framework to assess prioritized targets in a cell‐specific context. The screening platform established here involves perturbation of nominated targets in an appropriate cell line, and subsequent assays of cellular functions relevant to the hypotheses under investigation along with measurement of molecular changes. The molecular readouts also enable direct comparison to disease ‐omic measures to highlight which target perturbations drive molecular changes that are correlated or anti‐correlated with disease‐associated molecular changes. Through integration of the results from assays of cellular phenotypes with the specific and related proteomic changes, we identify the most robust targets that have direct impacts on the hypothesized biological functions and represent the strongest candidates for further development efforts. We screened 29 candidates linked to immune or mitochondrial hypotheses in BV2 microglia, and measured phenotypes and proteomic responses. We used this hypothesis validation workflow to filter the list of 29 candidate targets to five top‐tier targets that both impact relevant phenotypes and induce proteomic changes that reverse AD‐associated signatures: AP2A2, PDHB, PDHA1, DLAT, and PSMC3. Three of these targets (PDHA1, PDHB, and DLAT) encode protein components of the E1 and E2 subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, PSMC3 is a component of the 19S regulatory subunit of the proteasome, and AP2A2 is the alpha subunit of the adaptor protein complex AP‐2. Decreased expression and function of genes and proteins involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics, including PDH subunits, is an early and consistent hallmark of AD‐associated neurodegeneration (Figure S1A, 29 ). Animal model studies supports the role of PDH complex members in AD pathophysiology including that PDH kinase inhibition prevented neuron loss and improved memory performance, 30 that conditional knockout of Pdha1 impairs memory function, 31 and Dlat knockdown reduced neuronal damage and cognitive deficits. 32 There are likely cell type–specific implications of modulation of PDH given that phosphorylation levels of PDH are correlated with neuronal activity, 33 while shifts between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis are associated with changes in microglial states. 34 The results from our experiments support inhibition of PDH subunits impacting both mitochondrial membrane polarity and NFkB signaling (Figures 3C and 5A), as well as reversing disease‐associated proteomic signatures in both the mitochondrial metabolism and immune response biodomains (Figure 4C). While it may seem counterintuitive that knockdown of mitochondrial PDH complex members yields upregulation of mitochondrial proteins, partial inhibition of mitochondrial complex I has been shown to induce compensatory increases in mitochondrial gene expression. 35 Our findings capture similar network‐ level adaptive responses, revealing how modest perturbation may activate adaptive restorative programs. Such compensatory mechanisms may represent novel therapeutic avenues for rebalancing cellular bioenergetics in AD. Both PDHA1 and PDHB are targets that have been nominated by several AMP‐AD teams for therapeutic development 36 and here we find further evidence supporting their therapeutic potential. Like the PDH complex, there is extensive evidence that proteasome function is impaired early in AD pathogenesis, 37 , 38 and impaired proteasome functions are associated with memory deficits in mice. 39 While various neurodegeneration‐associated oligomeric proteins, including amyloid beta (Aβ), directly inhibit proteasome function, 40 , 41 increased proteasome activity has been observed in reactive glia around Aβ plaques. 42 While the proteasome is involved in activating NFkB signaling, 28 it also influences microglial cytokine signaling and memory performance in mouse models. 43 The specific implication of the PSMC3 subunit is supported by genetic fine mapping that identified PSMC3 among others at the CELF1/SPI1 locus 44 and methylation QTL studies that implicate differential methylation at the locus in AD risk. 45 Inhibition of Psmc3 induced a reversal of disease‐related immune response biodomain signatures and directly impacted immune and cell viability phenotypes, especially in the disease‐relevant Psen2 knockdown BV2 microglia line (Figures 3, 4, 5). Given the proteasomal involvement in activation of NFkB signaling, it is notable that inhibition of Psmc3 resulted in increased NFkB reporter activity. However, Psmc3 inhibition also resulted in generally increased expression of proteasome accessory subunit proteins, particularly in Psen2 knockdown BV2 cells (Figure 5A). Overall, these results support the therapeutic potential for modulation of the proteasome, including PSMC3, in AD. The AP2 complex participates in the assembly of clathrin‐coated vesicles (CCV) at the plasma membrane and induces clathrin‐mediated endocytosis along with CCV accessory proteins and AD risk genes PICALM and BIN1. 46 AP2 interacts with PICALM and LC3 to mediate the endocytosis and autophagy of the APP C‐terminal fragment, 47 and regulates the endosomal trafficking and lysosomal delivery of BACE1, influencing amyloid generation. 48 AP2 subunits have been found in detergent insoluble fractions in AD brains, 49 further supporting the association of the AP2 complex with neuropathological accumulation. Rare variation in a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region near AP2A2 is associated with neocortical phospho‐tau burden. 50 Importantly, the AP2 alpha subunits differentially associate with intraneuronal paired helical filaments (AP2A1) and IBA1+ microglia (AP2A2) in human brain tissue, 49 suggesting an approach to drive interventions toward either microglial or neuronal AP2 complexes. This is an important consideration given that neuronal‐specific knock‐outs of AP2 complex members lead to increased Aβ production, 48 whereas our results endorse inhibition of Ap2a2 in microglia as therapeutically beneficial. Ap2a2 knockdown in the Psen2 knockdown BV2 cell line reduced both microglial phagocytosis and NFkB signaling (Figure 3C), as well as decreased cell viability, perhaps in conjunction with alterations of cell cycle checkpoints (Figure 5A). Inhibition of Ap2a2 in BV2 microglia also reversed disease‐associated proteomic signatures in the mitochondrial metabolism and metal binding and homeostasis domains, and reversed oxidative stress, proteostasis, and vasculature biological domain signatures specifically in the Psen2 knockdown cells (Figure 4C). AP2 subunits including AP2A1, AP2B1, and AP2M1 have each been nominated by AMP‐AD investigators for therapeutic development, 36 and here we provide evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of an additional AP2 subunit, AP2A2. An important throughline in our data is the importance of including a sensitized cell condition. Using Psen2 knockdown BV2 cells revealed heightened baseline phagocytosis and AD‐relevant proteomic signatures (Figures 2, 3, and S2). Inclusion of the Psen2 knockdown line gets us closer to understanding the effects of target perturbation in a disease‐relevant context. Indeed, our results highlight many phenotypic and proteomic responses that are significant only in the sensitized cell line. While the inclusion of Psen2 knockdown cells here is revelatory, future efforts will explore additional disease‐relevant stressors such as exposure to oligomeric Aβ or oligomeric tau that may be more directly relevant to more common, late‐onset forms of AD. We found limited support for hypothesis specificity of target perturbations, potentially indicated coordinated disease relevance of metabolic and immune dysfunction. For example, only targets nominated from the mitochondrial metabolism hypothesis area impacted MitoTracker assay phenotypes and only targets nominated from the immune response hypothesis area had significant effects in the phagocytosis assay (Figure 3C). However, only immune response targets affected the metabolically sensitive alamarBlue assay phenotype, and both target sets affected NFkB reporter phenotypes (Figure 3C). Moreover, the proteomic responses of the targets showed no hypothesis specificity as the mitochondrial hypothesis targets Pdhb, Pdha1 and Dlat all reversed immune response domain proteomic responses, whereas the immune hypothesis targets Ap2a2 and Arhgef2 both reversed mitochondrial metabolism domain proteomic responses (Figure 4C). In the context of immune response and mitochondrial functions this is perhaps unsurprising, given what is known about the interplay of bioenergetics and immune functions. 51 , 52 , 53 We would not have appreciated this lack of target specificity were it not for our unbiased, multi‐dimensional screening strategy. We intend to refine the target and hypothesis nomination process based on the lessons learned here and, for example, would focus future hypotheses on points of functional convergence between biodomains. Several other limitations of this work restrict the nature of the conclusions we can draw. Because our screening system relies on immortalized murine BV2 cells, which diverge from human microglia in vivo, the results of this work should be viewed as primarily a filter for the nominated targets. We are able to rapidly prioritize candidates for further study using these results, and definitive target validation will require testing in human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived microglia or in vivo models. Another limitation is the reliance on siRNA‐mediated target knockdown, which introduces variability in the levels of target suppression (e.g., Figure S1C) and may include off‐target effects that confound interpretation. Follow‐up with approaches such as CRISPRa/CRISPRi systems, which enable the activation or inhibition, respectively, of target genes, would provide orthogonal data to support our conclusions. Indeed, the results from some targets imply that increasing expression of the target may be preferable; for example, knockdown of Yy1 produced disease‐correlated effects across domains suggesting that perhaps activation would lead to anti‐correlated, therapeutic effects. We have developed a robust platform for screening TREAT‐AD–nominated targets for functional engagement of biological hypotheses. Using this strategy filtered the list of 29 candidate targets to 5 top‐tier targets that are promising leads for further investigation and resource development by the Emory‐Sage‐SGC‐Jax TREAT‐AD center. The results from this work, as well as all enabling reagents developed through work by the center will be made openly available as a resource to the AD research community. Ultimately, the approach developed here demonstrates potential to accelerate AD therapeutic target discovery."

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia and a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Approximately 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and older are currently affected by AD, with projections indicating a rise to 13.8 million by 2060 due to environmental and socioeconomic factors . Patients with AD experience a gradual decline in cognitive function, including memory and thinking skills, as well as noticeable changes in social and behavioral interactions, limiting their ability to function independently . The pathogenesis mechanisms of AD are still elusive, with hallmark features such as the extracellular accumulation of amyloid‐beta (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) primarily composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein . These misfolded proteins are suggested to disrupt neuronal communication and elicit chronic neuroinflammation, leading to progressive neuronal damage and cognitive decline . The intricate interplay between these pathological hallmarks and other AD‐linked biological processes, such as neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated bioenergetics, RNA splicing dysregulation, and disrupted proteostasis, further complicates the disease's progression . To unravel the intricate interplay, a global‐scale understanding of dynamic protein dysregulation during AD pathogenesis is essential, as the proteins are workhorses and building blocks in the cell . Proteomics offers a powerful approach to unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying AD by enabling the comprehensive analysis of protein expression, degradation, modifications, and interactions . Recent technological advancements in proteomics have uncovered the complex interplays of AD‐involved proteins in greater depth, providing increased opportunities to discover new therapeutic targets and biomarkers . In this review, we delve into the proteomic insights that have advanced our knowledge of AD. By synthesizing the latest literature and integrating our own perspectives, we examine how advanced proteomic technologies have advanced our understanding of key biological pathways associated with AD pathology. We also discuss the proteomics technologies that are useful in better understanding the AD pathogenesis mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future direction of proteomics in advancing AD research.",
        "conclusion": "Proteomics research has substantially deepened our understanding of the multifaceted pathophysiology underlying AD. Identifying dysregulated pathways, particularly those involved in amyloid metabolism, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, protein degradation, RNA splicing, metabolic dysregulation, and synaptic dysfunction, underscores the critical role of proteomics in advancing our knowledge of AD pathology. These insights not only elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving disease progression but also highlight potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, most proteomic studies on human or animal tissues have been conducted at the bulk proteomics level, which provides only limited insights into cell‐dependent proteomic changes. For instance, proteomics research has identified RNA splicing factors as potentially important in the pathogenesis of AD. However, it remains unclear in which specific cell types these RNA splicing factors are dysregulated. To address this, cell‐type‐specific proteomic analysis, as discussed earlier, needs to be applied to human and animal brain samples. Even within the same cell type, there can be diverse subtypes with distinct functions. Neurons can be classified into excitatory and inhibitory types, which can be further divided into various subclasses . Similarly, astrocytes can be categorized as protoplasmic or fibrous astrocytes , and microglia can be divided into six subgroups, including Satellite microglia, KSPG‐microglia, and Hox8b‐microglia . To capture this heterogeneity, single‐cell proteomic analyses, as previously mentioned, should be employed to explore differences even among subtypes within the same cell population. Moreover, the functions of identical cell types can vary depending on their location in the brain. Spatial proteomics, as outlined earlier, can address this regional heterogeneity. By leveraging these advanced approaches, it becomes possible to uncover critical signaling pathways that might be overlooked in bulk proteomics studies. Additionally, integrating proteomic data with complementary omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, will be essential to construct a more comprehensive and systems‐level understanding of AD pathogenesis. Such efforts should be complemented by the development and refinement of bioinformatics tools and machine‐learning algorithms capable of handling the complexity and scale of proteomic data. These advancements will be pivotal in translating proteomic discoveries into clinical applications, ultimately informing the development of precision medicine strategies tailored to individual patient profiles. In conclusion, while proteomics has already contributed significantly to our understanding of AD, the continued evolution of proteomic technologies and their integration with other omics disciplines will be vital in overcoming the remaining challenges in AD research. By advancing these areas, we can enhance the precision and efficacy of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, bringing us closer to effective interventions for this devastating neurodegenerative disease."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a particular therapeutic challenge because its aetiology is very complex, with dynamic progression from preclinical to clinical stages. Several potential therapeutic targets and strategies were tested for AD, in over 2000 clinical trials, but no disease-modifying therapy exists. This failure indicates that AD, as a multifactorial disease, may require multi-targeted approaches and the delivery of therapeutic molecules to the right place and at the right disease stage. Opportunities to meet the challenges of AD therapy appear to come from recent progress in knowledge and methodological advances in the design, synthesis, and targeting of brain mRNA and microRNA with synthetic antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Several types of ASOs allow the utilisation of different mechanisms of posttranscriptional regulation and offer enhanced effects over alternative therapeutics. This article reviews ASO-based approaches and targets in preclinical and clinical trials for AD, and presents the future perspective on ASO therapies for AD.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversibly progressing, ageing-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 55 million people worldwide and the cause of 60-70% of dementia cases. By 2050 the number of AD patients is predicted to triple, making AD one of the major social threats of the 21st century given the complete absence of disease-modifying therapies . Currently AD is viewed as a progressing biological and clinical continuum. It starts within the temporal area of the brain in the hippocampus and is marked by extracellular deposits of Aβ peptides (senile plaques) and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Gradually AD progresses to the cerebral cortex and other brain areas and clinically manifests as progressing memory loss and cognitive impairment. Therapeutic approaches tested for AD can be classified as cell-based therapies, including stem cells or bone marrow transplants, and molecular therapies targeted to proteins or nucleic acids. Proteins are usually modified using antibodies or protein inhibitors, or replaced by synthetic proteins in enzyme replacement therapies. Gene therapy methods are aimed at correcting mutations in DNA using viral or plasmid vectors. In turn, therapies targeting RNA are developed mainly based on synthetic antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small synthetic molecules designed to regulate protein translation. The first step in the design of all targeted molecular therapies is identification of proper target(s) and their tissue and/or cellular location as a result of the investigation of pathways and molecules involved in a pathology. A review of more than 2000 interventional clinical trials of potential drugs for AD (closed or ongoing) shows that the dominant ones are based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis . More than 260 clinical trials have targeted the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide known to accumulate in the AD brain in the form of extracellular senile plaques. These result from faulty processing of transmembranous amyloid precursor protein (APP), first by β-secretase BACE1 and later by a complex of γ-secretase containing presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 (PS1, PS2) as enzymatic core. Immunotherapy with anti-Aβ antibodies was considered the likeliest strategy, recently exemplified by FDA accelerated approval for aducanumab (Biogen) which still requires verification of the expected clinical benefits. Amyloidogenic proteolysis of APP has also been targeted using BACE1 or PS1 inhibitors as potential therapeutics. Another popular target is microtubule associated tau protein (MAPT, tau) which, upon hyperphosphorylation by GSK3β, ERK1, CDK5, and some other kinases, is known to be deposited inside neurons in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and to impair axonal transport. Clinical trials targeting only tau protein as well as both tau and Aβ have been started, whereas the number of clinical trials aiming at targets other than Aβ or tau represent only about 1% Amyloid hypothesis-centred approaches in the drug development process originate from studies on the hereditary, early-onset, familial form of AD (FAD), that accounts for about 1% of AD incidences. FAD is predominantly caused by mutations in genes encoding APP, PS1, or PS2. It is now realised that the aetiology of sporadic, late-onset AD (SAD) is much more complex, with long-lasting, ageing-dependent dynamic development and progression from latent preclinical to clinical stages, modified by environmental risk factors . It seems that ageing-related metabolic and systemic low-grade inflammation can trigger AD by blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment and induction of neuroinflammation. At the cellular level, AD pathogenesis is currently seen as a result of several ageing-related molecular mechanisms which comprise, but are not limited to, loss of proteostasis, lipid dyshomeostasis, genomic instability, calcium dyshomeostasis, and mitochondrial and oxidative stress . AD, therefore, represents a particular therapeutic challenge. All AD clinical trials have failed to produce the expected results, questioning the applied therapeutic paradigms. What are the lessons from the clinical trials conducted so far? First, increased specificity of targeting is required to lower side effects of treatments. Second, choice of therapeutic targets should be adjusted to the disease stage and subtype. Third, AD as a multifactorial disease seems to require multi-targeted therapies, affecting several aspects of pathology. Fourth, once the therapeutic target(s) and its cellular/tissue location is established, the protocol for delivery of therapeutic agents has to be selected to ensure their efficient delivery to the right place and at the right time. The effective delivery of therapeutic agents, protected from degradation, to desired cells, with circumvention of the BBB and cell membrane to access subcellular targets is one of the major challenges to overcome for successful therapy. Targeting mRNA with short, synthetic, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) might help to respond to the above requirements. ASOs’ complementary binding with RNA based on Watson-Crick base pairing is of high specificity. Moreover, the technological advancements in the methods for ASO delivery to the brain have paved the way for their development as therapeutics in neurological diseases , , . In addition, discovery in 1990 of RNA interference, and of non-coding microRNAs (miRNA), opened exploration of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for ASOs. In the next chapters we compare strategies of mRNA and miRNA regulation using ASOs and review ASOs which proved successful in cellular and animal AD models. The ASO mimics illustrate that RNA can also play a vital effector function in molecular targeted therapies, whilst antagomiRs can target RNA.",
        "conclusion": "Despite huge efforts no approved disease-modifying AD therapies exist. Recent expansion in the understanding of AD pathogenesis beyond the role of Aβ and tau indicates multiple novel therapeutic targets related particularly to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which alter dynamically with AD progression. As a multifactorial and progressing disorder, AD is profoundly challenging and requires an appropriate, presently unavailable, therapeutic paradigm. Compared to traditional targeted molecular therapies, ASOs targeted to mRNA or miRNA seem to fulfil such requirements as they can be relatively easily delivered to the brain and they enable multi-targeting, adjusted moreover sequentially to the disease stage. ASOs offer the highest targeting specificity and a diverse spectrum of regulatory possibilities. ASOs directed to mRNA can not only block translation but also enhance it, allowing for either removal of malfunctioning proteins or restoration of properly functioning lost ones. Also, ASOs can uniquely allow selection of protein spliced variants. However, while so far ASOs have been tested for specific targeting of single mRNAs, their main advantage is the capacity for simultaneous regulation of several different transcripts. An additional dimension to this multi-targeting perspective came recently with the discovery of miRNAs. As one miRNA can regulate many proteins, often of the same signalling pathway, miRNA-based ASOs open the possibility for synchronous regulation of entire pathways and even cellular signalling networks. The proof of concept based on naturally existing miRNA-regulated networks can be found in reprogramming of somatic cells to stem cells using only two miRNAs. Such a network effect seems within reach with antagomiRs or mimics of endogenous cellular miRNAs but not with siRNAs which are each designed to one specific mRNA. This new concept of targeting whole signalling pathways with miRNA-based ASOs in AD is further supported given that over 70% of miRNAs in humans are expressed in the brain, and many are involved in the regulation of neuroinflammation and other key pathomechanisms of AD. The realisation of this strategy requires experimental verification of disease-associated miRNA networks. This knowledge is necessary for determining optimal miRNAs as targets of ASOs and for overcoming the risks associated with unwanted interactions and off-target effects. Increasingly accessible methods for high throughput single-cell proteomics and transcriptomics can support achieving this aim. Preclinical tests demonstrated the regulatory potential of mRNA and miRNA-based ASOs towards classical and novel targets identified in AD pathology, but these approaches are at an early stage and await further validation. These ASOs were tested in a very limited number of AD mouse models. The serious limitations of these mouse lines in reflecting the complexity of human SAD suggests that improved models are required. For instance, employing novel advanced animal and cellular models of SAD, such as iPS-derived human organoids obtained from somatic cells of AD patients, could help select ASOs for clinical trials. Among ASOs’ advantages for treatment of human brain diseases is the possibility of efficient, low-immunogenic delivery of ASOs to cells in the human brain. While brain delivery of chemically modified ASOs following injection to meninges or intravenously has been shown in rodents , this has yet to be emulated in humans, however progress is still being made . Alternative approaches such as transient permeabilisation of the BBB are also being explored . Upon delivery, ASOs trigger a transient effect making it easy to optimise doses, adjust formulations, or discontinue treatment in case of unwanted effects. In order to be viable therapeutic compounds, limitations such as: the physiological and economic effects of continued administration, potential long-term effects vs clearance in the body and the distribution following administration to required sites must be further optimised. Whilst the majority of current ASOs in the clinic are unencapsulated, the benefits of more specific tissue-/cell-targeting and enhanced cellular uptake should inspire developing novel encapsulation and surface functionalisation technologies. This could also aid the adjustment of the therapeutic ASO levels. Co-administration of ASOs along with well-established drugs is also pursued . In summary, ASOs targeted to mRNA and particularly miRNA offer potential for therapy of multifactorial diseases with complex aetiologies, such as AD. Examples of ASO translation to human clinical trials demonstrate that effective therapies are within reach, given further progress in ASO delivery methods and mechanistic understanding of miRNA-mRNA network regulation in AD."

        "title": "New Insights into lncRNAs in Aβ Cascade Hypothesis of Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, but its pathogenesis is not fully understood, and effective drugs to treat or reverse the progression of the disease are lacking. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abnormally expressed and deregulated in AD and are closely related to the occurrence and development of AD. In addition, the high tissue specificity and spatiotemporal specificity make lncRNAs particularly attractive as diagnostic biomarkers and specific therapeutic targets. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in AD is essential for developing new treatment strategies. In this review, we discuss the unique regulatory functions of lncRNAs in AD, ranging from Aβ production to clearance, with a focus on their interaction with critical molecules. Additionally, we highlight the advantages and challenges of using lncRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis or therapeutic targets in AD and present future perspectives in clinical practice.",
        "year": "2022",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36551230/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. The main pathophysiological features of AD are β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) aggregation forming senile plaques (SPs) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) aggregation leading to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) . The amyloid cascade hypothesis is thought to play an extremely important role in the pathogenesis of AD . Aβ, as the initiating link in AD pathogenesis, can trigger a series of downstream events, such as tau protein hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and synaptic dysfunction . Aβ oligomer theory suggests that soluble Aβ oligomers (oAβ), a major source of neurotoxicity, can cause neuronal damage at the nanomolar level . Hence, Aβ has been one of the most popular targets in AD drug research. However, clinical drugs targeting Aβ have not yet produced the desired effect, and clinical diagnosis and drug treatment for Aβ are facing considerable challenges . Therefore, an urgent need remains to explore further the causes of the imbalance in Aβ production and the clearance in AD patients, and to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathology better to develop new therapeutic targets. Approximately 75% of the human genome is transcribed, but only 2% of the transcribed genes encode mRNAs with protein synthesis potential. According to the ENCODE program, the vast majority of transcripts produce lncRNAs, of which up to 40% are preferentially expressed in the brain . Initially, lncRNAs were regarded as by-products of RNA polymerase II transcription, lacking biological function, so they were not widely appreciated . However, sensitive and precise high-throughput gene transcriptome sequencing revealed that the expression levels of many lncRNAs are significantly altered in the brains of AD patients . The expression levels of some lncRNAs in the brain, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients correlate with the severity of the disease . In vivo and in vitro experiments verified that lncRNAs play an important role in the Aβ cascade hypothesis, affecting the production, clearance, and neurotoxicity of Aβ. This suggests that lncRNAs play an integral role in the pathogenesis and staging of AD and may become new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for AD. Therefore, in this paper, we summarize the exact functions and related mechanisms of lncRNAs in Aβ deposition and neurotoxicity, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for lncRNAs to become diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for AD.",
        "conclusion": "Through high-throughput, whole-transcriptome analysis, researchers have identified many differentially expressed lncRNAs in the brains of AD patients, thereby providing important insights into the biological and clinical relevance of lncRNAs in AD. hese differentially expressed lncRNAs interact with different molecules to form complex functional networks during the Aβ cascade hypothesis (Figure 3). Dysregulation of Aβ homeostasis, leading to Aβ accumulation, is the most important trigger of AD . lncRNAs regulate the expression of AD-related genes through various mechanisms to play a key role in Aβ production, clearance, and its induced neurotoxicity (Table 1). As gene regulation research continues and more biological approaches emerge, the precise biological functions and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs will be further elucidated, which will not only deepen the understanding of the pathological mechanisms of AD but also provide more precise theoretical guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. The high tissue specificity and spatiotemporal specificity of lncRNAs make them particularly attractive as diagnostic biomarkers and specific therapeutic targets . Currently, the diagnosis of AD relies on clinical symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42, Aβ40, and amyloid PET-CT when Aβ has already been deposited in the brain, and the disease is usually in the middle to late stages. This is one of the reasons why drugs targeting Aβ have repeatedly failed. This diagnosis is only qualitative and does not achieve early disease prediction or staging. The expression of many lncRNAs changes incrementally, detrimentally, or even inversely during AD disease progression, suggesting that lncRNAs may be ideal biomarkers for AD. Additionally, lncRNAs act as functional molecules and their expression may be a more accurate indicator of disease status. lncRNAs such as lncRNA BACE1-AS have shown potential as AD biomarkers . Therefore, we need to further explore the role of lncRNAs in AD diagnosis to provide a theoretical basis for early diagnosis and disease staging of AD. An antisense drug, nusinersen, has been approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. Significantly, when given to symptomatic patients, nusinersen not only improves disease symptoms but also slows disease progression. Based on the early success of nusinersen, antisense drugs offer remarkable promise as treatments for neurological disorders . Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based lncRNA knockdown approaches may be an innovative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. Aβ accumulation in AD can be reduced by developing specific ASO downregulation lncRNAs, which is effective in AD cell models and animals . Therefore, we need to explore the molecular mechanisms and complex interaction networks of lncRNAs further for targeting lncRNAs to regulate Aβ homeostasis as a new therapeutic strategy for AD. By summarizing the literature, we also found that the target lncRNAs have all been differentially expressed in Aβ-induced animal or cellular models, which raises the question as to whether the abnormal expression of lncRNAs leads to Aβ accumulation or the accumulation of Aβ leads to the abnormal expression of lncRNAs. Aβ is detected in neurons in vivo, and endogenous Aβ42 or exogenously added Aβ42 taken up by cells can be transferred to the nucleus and is always present in low amounts in the nucleus, which supports the notion that Aβ begins to accumulate in the nucleus . Aβ42 can interact with specific gene regulatory elements to affect gene expression. Thus, the main deleterious effects in AD pathogenesis may be mediated by the genetic control activity of Aβ42, as it can act as a repressor or activator of gene transcription. Therefore, if nuclear translocation of Aβ can be inhibited, gene activation of lncRNA may be avoided, thus preventing the positive feedback that triggers Aβ accumulation. Therefore, we also need to explore further the nuclear translocation pattern of Aβ or how Aβ binds to target genes, leading to lncRNA transcription."

This review systematically summarizes the applications of single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches in AD research, with a focus on the characterization of cell type- and subtype-specific transcriptomic alterations. This review highlights key discoveries related to selectively vulnerable neuronal and glial subpopulations, as well as transcriptional dysregulation associated with genetic risk loci such as APOE and TREM2.

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prevalent and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, representing the leading cause of dementia and accounting for over 50% of cases worldwide . Clinically, AD is characterized by memory impairment, cognitive decline, and eventual loss of functional independence . According to global estimates, approximately 50 million individuals currently live with AD, with projections indicating a twofold increase by 2050, particularly in low- and middle-income countries . AD is the fifth leading cause of mortality globally, and among individuals age 75 and older, it is the fourth leading cause of disability and dependency . The hallmark neuropathological features of AD include progressive neuronal loss, extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein as neurofibrillary tangles . Additionally, the pathology of AD involves chronic neuroinflammation, glial cell activation, myelin disruption, synaptic dysfunction, and impaired autophagy, ultimately culminating in widespread neurodegeneration . Neuropathological studies have primarily focused on neuronal and synaptic damage, while molecular studies have elucidated the role of protein misfolding, aggregation, and deposition in disease progression . Over the past few years, increasing attention has been paid to neuroinflammatory processes, which are now recognized as central contributors to the pathogenesis of AD . Despite these advances, conventional research methodologies remain limited in their capacity to capture the intricate cellular heterogeneity and intercellular dynamics of the human brain. Bulk transcriptomic analyses average gene expression across mixed cell populations, thereby masking subtype-specific alterations. Moreover, commonly used animal models often fail to fully recapitulate the human-specific aspects of AD’s pathology due to species-specific biological differences . Single-cell sequencing technologies have emerged as powerful tools to address these limitations. By enabling transcriptomic profiling at single-cell resolution, these methods allow for the unbiased characterization of cellular diversity, subtype-specific gene expression patterns, and dynamic state transitions within complex tissues such as those in the brain . In AD research, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) have facilitated the identification of disease-associated cell populations and key regulatory pathways, thereby offering novel insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets . Moreover, single-cell approaches enable the analysis of cell–cell communication, signaling pathways, and microenvironmental changes that may drive disease progression (Fig. 1).Fig. 1The cumulative dysfunction of multiple cell types in Alzheimer’s disease drives the progression of neurodegeneration. Brain tissue was processed into a single-cell suspension and subjected to scRNA-seq analysis to explore cell heterogeneity. In AD, excitatory neurons exhibit hyperactivity before their loss while selectively vulnerable inhibitory neurons are depleted. Microglia in AD exist in various states, including resting microglia, MAEAD, and MALAD. TREM2 plays a key role by promoting the transcriptional activation of resting microglia, enabling them to engage in Aβ phagocytosis. However, microglial subpopulations involved in synaptic pruning and clearance are lost under AD-related stress. Moreover, astrocytes associated with AD downregulate neurotransmitter metabolism-related genes such as SLC1 A2 and GLUL, leading to dysregulation of neurotransmitter cycling. This dysfunction results in excitotoxicity, which contributes to neuronal death. Similarly, oligodendrocytes in AD downregulate myelination-related genes, including MAG and MOBP. This reduction in gene expression decreases the population of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, further promoting neuronal degeneration. In addition, vascular endothelial cells in AD upregulate angiogenesis-related genes like CLDN5, ERG, and VWF, which induce inflammation and cause immune dysregulation. At the same time, the downregulation of ABCB1 and ATP10 A in endothelial cells compromises the integrity of the BBB, leading to its disruption. This cumulative impact of dysfunction of various cell types in AD contributes to the overall progression of the disease. BBB, blood–brain barrier; MAEAD, microglia associated with early AD; MALAD, microglia associated with late AD The current review summarizes recent advances in the application of single-cell transcriptomics to AD research. It focuses on the characterization of cellular heterogeneity, the identification of vulnerable subpopulations, and the relationship between transcriptomic signatures and neuropathological stages. Additionally, it discusses how integrating single-cell data with other multi-omics and spatial techniques may inform future strategies for precision diagnostics and individualized therapeutics in AD. These insights are expected to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and facilitate the development of more effective, targeted interventions.",
        "conclusion": "Single-cell sequencing technology has revealed cellular heterogeneity in AD, providing new perspectives and opportunities for exploring the molecular mechanisms of this disease and potential therapeutic strategies. Future studies can combine single-cell sequencing with other methodologies to further investigate the role of cellular heterogeneity in AD and potential therapies. The future development of spatial transcriptomics will further reveal spatial patterns of gene expression, expanding our understanding of the functional complexity of brain cells. snRNA-seq has already been integrated with spatial transcriptomics to detect genome-wide transcriptional changes induced by amyloid plaques in situ. One spatial transcriptomics study found that early AD was characterized by changes in gene co-expression networks enriched for myelin and oligodendrocyte-related genes, while late AD stages were characterized by multi-cell gene co-expression networks prominently involving the complement system, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and inflammation . Spatial single-cell transcriptomics provides insights into the spatial characteristics of gene expression influenced by the local microenvironment, which, when combined with gene expression profiling, should offer a more comprehensive view of brain cell functionality. In conclusion, the application of single-cell multi-omics to AD research has revealed the diversity of brain cell populations and provided detailed insights into the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, including DNA polymorphisms, mutations, methylation, histone modifications, and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Integrating single-cell multi-omics enhances our understanding of dynamic gene expression, phenotypic changes, and epigenetic control in AD, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies. Single-cell sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of AD by enabling the unprecedented resolution of cellular diversity and transcriptional dynamics within the diseased brain. Through an analysis of distinct cell types and subpopulations, these technologies have yielded novel insights into the molecular and functional heterogeneity that underpins the pathogenesis of AD. Table 2 summarizes major AD-related genes and their transcriptomic alterations across brain cell types. First, single-cell approaches have uncovered disease-associated patterns of gene expression and regulatory pathways that are often masked in bulk analyses. Second, mapping transcriptomic changes across the stages of AD has highlighted potential links between cellular trajectories and pathological progression, allowing for the identification of selectively vulnerable cell types and their temporal dynamics during disease progression. Third, the integration of single-cell multi-omics with spatial and epigenomic data is paving the way for the development of individualized therapeutic strategies. These approaches may not only help to discover new molecular targets but also provide a roadmap for precision medicine in AD.

        "title": "APP dyshomeostasis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: implications for current drug targets.",
        "abstract": "The Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane glycoprotein from which amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are generated after proteolytic cleavage. Aβ peptides are the main constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The physiological functions of APP in the human adult brain are very diverse including intracellular signaling, synaptic and neuronal plasticity, and cell adhesion, among others. There is growing evidence that APP becomes dysfunctional in AD and that this dyshomeostasis may impact several APP functions beyond Aβ generation. The vast majority of current anti-amyloid approaches in AD have focused on reducing the synthesis of Aβ or increasing the clearance of brain Aβ aggregates following a paradigm in which Aβ plays a solo in APP dyshomeostasis. A wider view places APP at the center stage in which Aβ is an important, but not the only, factor involved in APP dyshomeostasis. Under this paradigm, APP dysfunction is universal in AD, but with some differences across different subtypes. Little is known about how to approach APP dysfunction therapeutically beyond anti-Aβ strategies. In this review, we will describe the role of APP dyshomeostasis in AD beyond Aβ and the potential therapeutic strategies targeting APP.",
        "year": "2024",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation in the brain of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The central hypothesis in AD revolves around the notion that amyloid plaques enhance the pathological aggregation of tau, which leads to increased neurofibrillary tangle formation, synaptic and neuronal loss. Under this paradigm, the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, the main constituent of amyloid plaques, has been conceptualized as one of the central therapeutic targets for disease modification in AD. The recent data from the clinical trials with lecanemab and donanemab in AD clearly support the rationale of anti-amyloid therapy and the important role of Aβ in disease pathogenesis. However, it is recognized that the pathophysiology of AD is much more complex and goes beyond the role of Aβ, or amyloid plaques. Amyloid pathology does not correlate well with cognitive deficits and there is a topographical mismatch between amyloid and tau pathology in the early stages of the disease. In addition, cell loss is not directly related to Aβ plaques or neurofibrillary tangles . Although the topography of tau pathology is more closely associated with the clinical syndrome compared to amyloid pathology , synapse loss is the best neuropathological correlate of cognitive deficits in AD . Brain resilience and the existence of other pathological comorbidities may explain some of these discrepancies, but it is also possible that the mismatch between AD pathology and clinical signs is due to other undetected/unnoticed changes related to AD pathophysiology. One aspect that has not been fully addressed is the role of dyshomeostasis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the pathogenesis of AD . This conceptualization implies that the entire transmembrane protein is involved in AD pathogenesis, rather than the resultant proteolytic product (Aβ) only. APP dyshomeostasis can lead to an array of synergistic mechanisms beyond Aβ production and deposition that can independently contribute to neuronal and synaptic derangement. In this review we will elaborate on the basis for this paradigm and will discuss the implications for current and future therapeutic strategies. This review will not cover strategies aimed at targeting Aβ production or aggregation directly or indirectly that have been extensively reviewed .",
        "conclusion": "In light of the increase in the investment for AD research, it is critical to further consider other targets beyond Aβ and tau. One target that has gained little attention is APP itself. Instead of the current dogma where Aβ plays a solo role in APP dyshomeostasis, a wider view can place APP at the center stage. In this scenario, the field would benefit from novel therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring APP dysfunction in concert with anti-Aβ therapies. The most direct application of an APP-restorative approach would be to downregulate the synthesis of APP through antisense oligonucleotide therapy in individuals with APP duplications or with DS. In these AD subtypes this strategy could restore the main causative driver of AD pathology. The application of this strategy to cases without APP gene dosage changes remains more speculative as the effects of APP downregulation on physiological APP functions are uncertain. Subjects with missense APP mutations could be treated using gene therapy with CRISPR-Cas9 to correct the mutation early in life using adenovirus. The approach in sporadic AD poses a more complex scenario because much less is known about the contribution of APP dyshomeostasis to the disease. However, risk variants in the APP gene have been reported in sporadic AD in some GWAS studies and APP accumulates in AD in neurons prone to neurodegeneration suggesting a contributing role in sporadic AD as well. In this common form of AD, a combination therapy using different strategies to restore APP homeostasis together with immunotherapy against Aβ could be envisioned if these approaches show benefit individually. It is also likely that some specific subgroups of sporadic AD may show enhanced APP dyshomeostasis, and may be eligible for intervention. This scenario is in line with a personalized medicine approach, in which different subgroups of sporadic AD are treated with different strategies directed at specific pathophysiological pathways. Despite the evidence that APP becomes dysfunctional in AD, APP dyshomeostasis has not been fully approached from a therapeutic perspective beyond anti-Aβ interventions. Under this wider paradigm more studies are needed to investigate the degree and nature of APP dysfunction in different subtypes of AD, and how to approach therapeutically APP dysfunction beyond anti-Aβ. This holistic view could yield new strategies to enrich the therapeutic arsenal for this devastating disease."

        "abstract": "There is now a convincing body of evidence from observational studies that the majority of modifiable Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) risk factors are vascular in nature. In addition, the co-existence of cerebrovascular disease with AD is more common than AD alone, and conditions resulting in brain ischemia likely promote detrimental effects of AD pathology. Oxylipins are a class of bioactive lipid mediators derived from the oxidation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which act as modulators of both vascular tone and inflammation. In vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), there is emerging evidence that oxylipins may have both protective and detrimental effects on brain structure, cognitive performance, and disease progression. In this review, we focus on oxylipin relationships with vascular and inflammatory risk factors in human studies and animal models pertinent to ADRD. In addition, we discuss future research directions with the potential to impact the trajectory of ADRD risk and disease progression.",
        "year": "2022",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36144230/",
        "introduction": "There are currently an estimated 55 million individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) worldwide, and this figure is projected to increase to 78 million by 2030, coincident with a growing global elderly population . ADRD contributes to a diminished quality of life for patients and caregivers, and results in significant individual and societal financial burdens. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is one of the largest single identifiable risk factor for dementia apart from age, and one of the few that is potentially preventable . This is made all the more important in light of evidence that combinations of different co-pathologies are more important in predicting cognitive impairment than any single pathology . In particular, mixed AD and vascular pathologies increase one’s risk for dementia nearly two-fold compared with those with AD pathology alone . Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and AD share common risks factors , and post-mortem studies demonstrate correlations between the presence of AD and CVD pathologies . Potential cerebrovascular contributions to ADRD include diminished cerebral perfusion, inflammation, and impaired clearance of toxic solutes, including amyloid beta and tau, involving paravascular drainage pathways . In addition, ADRD risk factors include diseases of the peripheral cardiovascular system, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as conditions that alter peripheral vascular beds and blood flow, such as diabetes . It is recognized that even modest delays in dementia onset at the individual level could have a significant impact on dementia prevention on a global scale . There is, therefore, an urgent need for accessible means, including dietary modifications, by which individuals may optimize their vascular health. A diet rich in omega-3 fatty polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is thought to be neuroprotective, and is recommended for primary and secondary stroke prevention . However, the exact mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids confer beneficial effects on brain health are not well defined, and results from epidemiological studies and clinical trials aimed at preserving cognitive function in aging and AD have shown mixed results. Diets with a higher omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid ratio have been shown to promote ADRD risk factors, such as adiposity and inflammation ; however, little is known about the downstream PUFA metabolites that may be driving these relationships. Oxylipins are a class of bioactive lipid mediators derived from the metabolism of long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that act as modulators of both vascular tone and inflammation. There is emerging evidence that PUFA-derived oxylipins may confer both positive and detrimental effects. In this review, we focus on the relationships between PUFA-derived oxylipins and ADRD risk with an emphasis on CVD. The overall goal of this review is to highlight the potential mechanisms by which PUFA-derived oxylipins may serve as targets for interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function in older individuals.",
        "conclusion": "Long-chain PUFAs have been studied for over 30 years in ADRD risk conditions that include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and in AD. To date, omega-3 PUFAs evaluated in AD and AD prevention clinical trials have shown no clear benefit. PUFAs sequestered in phospholipid membranes in peripheral and brain tissues are released and oxidized to form oxylipins that have potent bioactive effects, and have been understudied in ADRD. Specific oxylipins that may be relevant to ADRD due to their effects on the vasculature include: LOX-dependent LA-derived HODEs; EPA-derived HEPEs; CYP-dependent LA-derived epoxides 9,10- and 12,13-EpOMEs; EPA-derived epoxide 17,18-EpETE; DHA-derived epoxides 16,17- and 19,20-EpDPE; and CYP sEH-dependent LA-derived 9,10- and 12,13-DiHOMEs; EPA-derived 17,18-DiHETE; and DHA-derived 16,17-EpDPE, 19,20-EpDPE, and 19,20-DiHDPA. Future research focused more specifically on the effects of sEH activity on vascular tone, neurovascular coupling, neuroinflammation, cognitive performance, and vascular brain injury, and relationships between these distinct outcome measures using animal models, and in vivo MRI techniques in both animal and human studies, are warranted. Integrating MRI with plasma biomarker data and incorporating information regarding genetic and dietary heterogeneity will allow for a better understanding regarding the role of specific oxylipins in regulating cerebrovascular health, which is highly relevant for refining strategies to treat and even prevent ADRD using dietary interventions and dietary supplements. More studies performing in-depth pharmacognostical analyses of the types of PUFAs in different dietary sources will further improve the design and efficacy of such interventions."

        "abstract": "Phytochemicals or natural products have been studied extensively for their potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc. The neuronal structure loss and progressive dysfunction are the main characteristics of these diseases. In spite of impressive and thorough knowledge of neurodegenerative molecular pathways, little advancement has been found in the treatment of the same. Moreover, it was proved that natural products can be used efficiently in the treatment of NDs while certain issues regarding the patient's safety and clinical data are still existing. As ND is a bunch of diseases and it will start the myriad of pathological processes, active targeting of the molecular pathway behind ND will be the most efficient strategy to treat all ND-related diseases. The targeting pathway must prevent cell death and should restore the damaged neurons. In the treatment of ND and related diseases, natural products are playing the role of neuroprotective agents. This review will target the therapeutic potential of various phytochemicals which shows neuroprotective action.",

        "introduction": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are a group of chronic, progressive central nervous system disorders, characterized by the degradation, and subsequent loss of neurons. NDs are an increasing source of death and morbidity worldwide, especially among the elderly, making them one of the most promising public health issues. Because of their irreversibility, lack of effective treatment, and associated social and economic consequences, age-related diseases such as NDs are becoming increasingly relevant. Acute neurodegeneration is a disorder in which neurons are injured rapidly and frequently die as a result of traumatic events including, strokes, head injury, traumatic brain injury, ischemic brain damage, and cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Whereas, chronic neurodegeneration is a long-term condition in which neurons in the nervous system experience a neurodegenerative process that begins slowly and worsens over time due to a variety of factors, resulting in the irreversible death of explicit neuron inhabitants. Chronic neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington’s disease . Alzheimer’s disease is an age-related, chronic, and progressive neurological illness that causes memory and cognitive impairments, as well as behavioral changes. It is characterized by two important neuropathological characteristics such as production and deposition of the extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain, and protein accretion of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau proteins termed neurofibrillary tangles. Parkinson’s disease is a chronic and progressive neurological illness that affects motor functioning by causing a progressive loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. It causes bradykinesia, postural imbalance, resting tremor, and muscular rigidity. Parkinson's disease is distinguished by the accretion of Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites, and intracellular protein aggregates, which are primarily composed of the misfolded and aggregated forms of presynaptic protein alpha (α)-synuclein, as well as the progressive loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons . Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is another progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the progressive degeneration and death of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death from respiratory failure. The mechanisms underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are unknown, but several factors such as genetic factors, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, impaired axonal transport, autoimmune response, environmental factors, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurofilament aggregation have been considered. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is allied to a mutation in the gene that codes for the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) enzyme. Whereas, Huntington’s disease is a condition of neurological illness that is pathologically defined by enhanced dopaminergic activity and reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) functioning in the basal ganglia, and clinically defined by psychiatric disturbances, cognitive deficits, and abnormal movements. It is triggered by a trinucleotide reiteration development of the nucleotide’s cytosine, adenine, and guanine (a CAG expansion) in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, which is located on the petite arm of chromosome-4 .",
        "conclusion": "The process of natural neuroprotection against various neurodegenerative diseases is widely accepted nowadays by using various natural herbs whole or using their products. Despite a number of favorable incidents depicting the use of natural herbs for the treatment of neurodegeneration, a successful transformation of these herbs from research to commercialization are still lacking as preclinical evidence are there but clinical testing of the same is still lacking. Natural products and their byproducts face many challenges from the point of view of their solubility, biostability, physical and chemical stability, metabolism, BBB crossing, and therapeutic efficacy. A number of natural compounds like resveratrol, turmeric, and apigenin possess numerous neuroprotective potentials but face the problem in respect of stability, solubility, and bioavailability. The BBB prevents the crossing of the compounds and hereby hinders their movement from blood to the brain. However, nanotechnology and nanocarriers can play an important role in their bioavailability enhancement. Natural products when entrapped in nanocarriers can increase the bioavailability and stability of the products. Various types of nanocarriers like nanogels, nanoparticles, emulgel, nanosuspension, self-micro emulsifying drug delivery systems, nanostructured lipid carriers, and Nano micelles can be prepared for the delivery of phytoconstituents. A number of studies have been published in the literature in which nanocarriers have been used for the entrapment of phytoconstituents and they significantly enhanced their stabilization and solubilization . The therapeutic potential of phytoconstituents to act as neuroprotective has been supported by a vast number of literature. Natural compounds are well known for their bioactivities such as reactive oxygen scavenging activity, antioxidant action, antiproliferative action, antimicrobial, anticancer, and neuroprotective actions. Various compounds such as luteolin, hesperidin, resveratrol, genistein, and many other compounds are there which are much more effective against neurodegeneration. However, their actions are limited due to their solubility, stability, and therapeutic efficacy-related problems. It was envisaged from the published data that the therapeutic action of the natural compounds can be enhanced by incorporating the phytoconstituents in the nanocarriers such as nanoparticles, nanogels, and nanostructured lipid carriers. They can enhance the stability and specificity of the bioactive compounds to a larger extent. The use of nanotechnology can also provide targeting which enhances their specificity to the respective site of action."

        "title": "Disease-Modifying Treatments and Their Future in Alzheimer's Disease Management.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment, a loss of cholinergic neurons, and cognitive decline that insidiously progresses to dementia. The pathoetiology of AD is complex, as genetic predisposition, age, inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated proteostasis all contribute to its development and progression. The histological hallmarks of AD are the formation and accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and interfibrillar tau tangles within the central nervous system. These histological hallmarks trigger neuroinflammation and disrupt the physiological structure and functioning of neurons, leading to cognitive dysfunction. Most treatments currently available for AD focus only on symptomatic relief. Disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) that target the biology of the disease in hopes of slowing or reversing disease progression are desperately needed. This narrative review investigates novel DMTs and their therapeutic targets that are either in phase three of development or have been recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The target areas of some of these novel DMTs consist of combatting amyloid or tau accumulation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and dysregulated proteostasis, metabolism, or circadian rhythm. Neuroprotection and neuroplasticity promotion were also key target areas. DMT therapeutic target diversity may permit improved therapeutic responses in certain subpopulations of AD, particularly if the therapeutic target of the DMT being administered aligns with the subpopulation's most prominent pathological findings. Clinicians should be cognizant of how these novel drugs differ in therapeutic targets, as this knowledge may potentially enhance the level of care they can provide to AD patients in the future.",

        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618323/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that commonly presents with short-term memory loss that insidiously progresses to dementia. Cognitive decline with a strong association with the loss of cholinergic neurons, impaired memory, and possible motor abnormalities that affect speech, behavior, and visuospatial orientation are characteristic of AD . Unfortunately, this debilitating disease is extremely prevalent. Its prevalence is so widespread that it accounts for up to 60%-80% of all cases of dementia, making it the leading cause . The etiology of AD is multifactorial, but advanced age is the strongest risk factor. This is exemplified by the 10% prevalence rate in individuals over the age of 65 which significantly increases to 40% for those over the age of 80 . The prevalence rate of AD will continue to rise as the growing population of the United States continues to age. Fueled by impressive advancements in life expectancy, the global population aged 65 or older is anticipated to grow from approximately 524 million in 2010 to nearly 1.5 billion by 2050, with the majority of this growth occurring in developing nations . AD will create even more of a burden on health care in the future than it does today. The World Health Organization update on the epidemiology of AD in 2013 predicted the number of people worldwide suffering from dementia (35.6 million) to triple by the year 2050 . This concerning rise in prevalence can be attributed to AD's association with advanced age and an increasing global life expectancy. Despite the frightening prevalence of AD, only symptomatic treatment was largely available for patients until recently. Symptomatic relief of memory impairment and the restored ability to perform some activities of daily living have shown promising results with the use of cholinesterase and N-methyl-d-aspartate inhibitors in patients with AD . The development and introduction of novel treatments that not only relieve symptoms but also modify disease progression are of great importance. The pathophysiology of AD is complex. Genetic predisposition, gliosis, neural inflammation, dysregulated production and removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted sleep parameters, brain hypometabolism, and excess metal ion accumulation have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD . This complexity makes the development of efficacious, disease-modifying drugs so difficult. The histopathological hallmarks found in AD are the formation and accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles. Amyloid-β peptides are the proteolytic fragments of the transmembrane receptor, Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). As illustrated by Figure 1, an abnormal increase in the enzymatic cleavage of APP by β-secretase in AD results in a misfolded amyloid-β protein that is more susceptible to aggregation extracellularly . This aggregation forms the hallmark amyloid-β plaques found in AD, which promote neurotoxicity by inducing oxidative stress and inflammation, triggering mitochondrial dysfunction, altering membrane permeability, and interfering with synaptic function resulting in neurodegeneration . Neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are another histopathological hallmark of AD . The tau protein is involved in the stabilization of microtubules, which are vital structures for the functioning of axonal transport and dendrites in neurons . As illustrated by Figure 2, when tau protein is hyperphosphorylated it decreases its affinity for microtubules and increases its affinity for other tau proteins, forming neurofibrillary tangles . Cognitive decline in AD progresses as the impaired functionality of tau proteins found in neurofibrillary tangles fails to augment neuronal connections and communication. Tau-dependent microtubule assembly, axonal trafficking, and dendrite structure formation are all key events needed for neurocognition . Neuroinflammation is a key component in the pathology of AD. Chronic stimulation of cytokine-secreting microglia and astrocytes residing in the brain promotes an immune response that can potentially exacerbate amyloid-β deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy . Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a term designated to characterize an accumulation of amyloid within or around cerebral blood vessels. Amyloid deposits around cerebral blood vessels alter the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and can lead to extravasations of plasma proteins, cerebral edema, and release of pro-inflammatory mediators . Chronic neuroinflammation in AD is critical to the progression of the disease because it results in a positive feedback loop, where chronic neuroinflammation exacerbates the deposition of the histopathologic findings of AD, while at the same time, the deposition of these plaques and neurofibrillary tangles directly promote inflammation . There is a plethora of novel treatments for AD in development at several different phases in drug trials. One hundred and eighty-seven unique treatment agents for AD are undergoing trials as of January 1, 2023 . Disease modification was by far the most common classification of drug agents undergoing testing in these trials as 79% of the agents targeted disease modification . Disease-modifying treatment (DMT) is a label given to therapeutic agents whose purpose is to change the biology or slow the progression of AD . It is reassuring that the major area of focus for drug development regarding novel treatments for AD is DMTs, as aducanumab and lecanemab are the only DMTs readily available today. This narrative review aims to investigate DMTs that have recently received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in addition to DMTs in phase three of development that have the potential for approval in the near future. Figure 3 and Table 1 illustrate the diversity in therapeutic target areas of these novel DMTs.",
        "conclusion": "AD is a debilitating disease that is expected to become more prevalent as our population ages. Currently, only two DMTs are approved for AD treatment, but they are only beneficial to a limited segment of the AD population. The development of new drugs and therapies that target not just the symptoms, but also reverse or slow disease progression is imperative. Fortunately, there are several DMTs on the horizon that have the potential for FDA approval. Practicing clinicians should be cognizant of how these novel drugs differ in their therapeutic targets. Due to the complex and overarching pathoetiology of AD, a DMT with a particular therapeutic target may be more efficacious than other DMTs with different therapeutic targets, particularly if the therapeutic target of the DMT being administered aligns with the subpopulation’s most prominent pathological findings. However, future research comparing DMTs with different therapeutic targets and their efficacy in treating various populations of AD patients is needed for confirmation. The target areas of some DMTs that may soon be introduced clinically consist of therapies against amyloid and tau proteins, oxidative stress, inflammation, dysregulated proteostasis, dysregulated circadian rhythms, and dysregulated metabolism. Other DMTs that are on the horizon for FDA approval focus on neuroprotection or the promotion of neuroplasticity to slow the progression of AD."

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The Alzheimer's disease (AD) research community continues to make great strides in expanding approaches for early detection and treatment of the disease, including recent advances in our understanding of fundamental AD pathophysiology beyond the classical targets: beta-amyloid and tau. Recent clinical trial readouts implicate a variety of non-amyloid/non-tau (NANT) approaches that show promise in slowing cognitive decline for people with AD. The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) meeting held on December 13-14, 2022, reviewed the current state of NANT targets on underlying AD pathophysiology and their contribution to cognitive decline, the current data on a diverse range of NANT biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and the integration of NANT concepts in clinical trial designs. Participants also discussed the current definition of therapies that target underlying AD pathophysiology, what endpoints best define what is considered a meaningful change beyond the current approved definition for clinical efficacy, and how the recent NANT findings should inform the development of future guidelines for AD classification and personalized treatment strategies. HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) convened leaders from industry, academia, and government to review the current state of non-beta amyloid and non-tau (NANT) targets on underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology.The totality of scientific and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that emerging NANT targets play a role in cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD. New biomarkers based on NANT targets must be globally developed and implemented with specific consideration of fluid biomarkers as a cost-effective clinical option, to ensure better, more equitable treatment options for AD.",
        "year": "2024",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39748839/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a complex underlying pathophysiology that shifts throughout the clinical course from cognitively normal to end‐stage dementia. Decades of scientific and clinical research have built the framework for defining pathologies of AD based on amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. 1 Recent clinical trials of therapeutics have led to United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of treatments targeting beta‐amyloid and thus supporting the amyloid hypothesis as a part of pathogenesis. Beta‐amyloid is posited to trigger a cascade of events and different processes including inflammatory responses that result in disease progression and cognitive and functional decline. 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 Emerging evidence suggests non‐amyloid/non‐tau (NANT) targets may not only contribute to cognitive decline but may have additional clinical implications in AD. Given the emerging data on the relevance of NANT targets and biomarkers to AD pathophysiology and therapeutics, the Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) chose this topic for its December 2022 meeting. The December 2022 AARR convened leaders from industry and academia, as well as patients, clinicians, and government and regulatory agency scientists to discuss the topic, “Modifying the Underlying Biology of AD; Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Non‐Amyloid/Non‐Tau Trials.” Collectively, all stakeholders agreed that the totality of scientific and clinical evidence supports the thesis that NANT targets play a role in cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD, and have the potential to inform treatment strategies, alongside beta‐amyloid and tau. Here, we report the proceedings of the AARR meeting that addressed three fundamental questions: (1) what is the evidence regarding the relationship between AD pathophysiology and NANT targets? (2) what evidence supports the clinical utility of NANT targeted therapies and biomarkers? and (3) how does this evidence impact the framework for defining and treating AD?",
        "conclusion": "During the December 2022 AARR, participants aimed to answer three fundamental questions: (1) what is the role of NANT targets in AD? (2) does the current evidence support a clinical benefit of NANT biomarkers and targeted therapies? and (3) how does this evidence impact the framework for defining and treating AD? At the conclusion of the 2‐day meeting, presenters, panelists, and the AARR membership in attendance came to several conclusions based on the totality of scientific evidence presented and discussed. First, the scientific and clinical data support the hypothesis that NANT biomarkers and targets can help us better understand the underlying pathophysiology of AD. Second, NANT biomarkers and targets show great promise in preclinical and early clinical studies, but there is still work to be done to fully explore their clinical potential. Last, as new NANT biomarkers for disease classification and clinical progression monitoring emerge, as well as new NANT targets for disease modification, guidelines must be established to ensure their proper implementation within the current research framework. In addition to highlighting the current evidence to date of the clinical potential of NANT biomarkers, participants also discussed the need to define what questions should NANT biomarkers aim to answer about the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Collectively, NANT biomarkers have the potential to be used diagnostically, alongside the current classification systems, to inform on clinical efficacy, and/or to be used for safety monitoring, for instance predicting and tracking amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) or other adverse events. Cross‐sectional and longitudinal data will be key for elucidating the utility of each NANT biomarker or panel of NANT biomarkers. Other considerations include where individual NANT biomarkers fall within the disease progression continuum, and whether they can act as a surrogate for measuring underlying shifts in neurodegeneration. Further, even in homogeneous populations, NANT biomarkers can be inherently variable, and may require large sample sizes and longer trial durations for validation. Last, not all NANT biomarkers are also ideal therapeutic targets, and may only serve as an up‐ or downstream readout of the underlying disease modification; thus, additional in vivo studies may be required to understand these discrepancies. Participants also discussed important considerations for developing NANT targeted therapies. Given that many NANT targets aim to modify an underlying pathophysiology that may shift throughout the clinical progression of AD, there is a need to better understand stage‐specific treatment strategies. Additionally, preliminary trials with shorter intervention intervals may provide insights into optimal therapeutic windows for NANT targets based on pharmacodynamic studies. Another key consideration for evaluating specific NANT targets is whether the target will offer a symptomatic or disease modifying treatment option. For example, some NANT targets may be better suited for use as a combination therapy with other disease modifying treatments, with potential for a synergistic effect. Finally, as more NANT targeted therapies advance in clinical trials, consideration will need to be given to redefining efficacy and inclusion criteria beyond amyloid and tau. AARR participants collectively agreed that the totality of scientific and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that emerging NANT targets play a role in cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD. However, more work is needed to understand their intersection and positioning within the recently published revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease. 13 In addition, new biomarkers based on NANT targets need to be developed that can be easily implemented on a global scale, with an emphasis on incorporating more fluid biomarkers as a cost‐effective clinical option, to ensure better, more equitable treatment options for AD. Future directions that will continue to move the field forward include creating a biomarker system that allows for subdividing patient populations and providing personalized treatment strategies."

        "title": "Medicine-Food Herbs against Alzheimer's Disease: A Review of Their Traditional Functional Features, Substance Basis, Clinical Practices and Mechanisms of Action.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that currently has reached epidemic proportions among elderly populations around the world. In China, available traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) that organically combine functional foods with medicinal values are named \"Medicine Food Homology (MFH)\". In this review, we focused on MFH varieties for their traditional functional features, substance bases, clinical uses, and mechanisms of action (MOAs) for AD prevention and treatment. We consider the antiAD active constituents from MFH species, their effects on in vitro/in vivo AD models, and their drug targets and signal pathways by summing up the literature via a systematic electronic search (SciFinder, PubMed, and Web of Science). In this paper, several MFH plant sources are discussed in detail from in vitro/in vivo models and methods, to MOAs. We found that most of the MFH varieties exert neuroprotective effects and ameliorate cognitive impairments by inhibiting neuropathological signs (Aβ-induced toxicity, amyloid precursor protein, and phosphorylated Tau immunoreactivity), including anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, antiautophagy, and antiapoptosis, etc. Indeed, some MFH substances and their related phytochemicals have a broad spectrum of activities, so they are superior to simple single-target drugs in treating chronic diseases. This review can provide significant guidance for people's healthy lifestyles and drug development for AD prevention and treatment.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a specific onset and process of cognitive and functional decline with particular neurological characteristics, especially in people over 65 years of age with high morbidity and mortality . Prince M et al. estimated that 65.7 million people in 2030 and 115.4 million people in 2050 will live with dementia worldwide, which implies an extremely serious burden to global public health and social welfare . Deficits in the ability to encode and store new memories characterize the initial stages of the disease. Subsequent progressive changes in cognition and behavior accompany the later stages. Due to the complexity of the etiology of AD, its pathological and physiological mechanisms have been controversial. To date, the core pathological hallmarks recognized by researchers are amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synapses, and/or neuronal loss . At present, the main licensed pharmacologic therapy of patients is cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonists (memantine). Cholinesterase inhibitors are licensed therapy for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease, and NMDA antagonists are licensed therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe AD . Other treatments include immunotherapy (bapineuzumab), amyloid aggregators (tramiprosate), tau aggregation inhibitors (methylthioninium chloride), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitors (lithium), and natural products and vitamins (ginkgo biloba, omega 3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid, and vitamin E) . In recent years, with the improvement of public health awareness, people have paid increasing attention to the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases through diet, such as a “low-, fermentable oligo-, and di-, monosaccharides and polyols” diet, Mediterranean diet, a low-lactose diet, and medicinal food herb diet . The concept of medicine food homology (MFH) originally came from the (Huangdi’s) Internal Classic in ancient China, which means that Chinese medicine and food are of the same origin, and, thus, they can be used as food and administered to patients as medication to regulate the human body’s metabolic disturbances or imbalances . In China, many traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are functional foods and dietary supplements, such as Panax ginseng C.A. Mey., Crocus sativus L., and Angelica acutiloba (Siebold & Zucc.) Kitag. For cultural reasons, herbal remedies are called alternative therapies in North America and other countries . MFH substances with abundant resources have exhibited pharmacological effects at preventing and treating a variety of diseases, including cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, viruses, influenza, and, in particular, chronic diseases . To ensure the safety of functional foods from TCM, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China released specific provisions on MFH items, which considered 109 TCMs as functional foods for alleviating or curing various chronic diseases through the diet as of 2019 . For this paper, the literature review covers the period between 2001 and 2021 relating to MFH items with antiAD effects. The literature was collected from the SciFinder, EMBASE, Mendeley, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. The keywords used for the literature search were as follows: “Medicine-food Herb and Alzheimer’s disease”, “Medicine-food Herb and chemical components or phytoconstituents or natural products”, and “Medicine-food Herb and clinical evidence and Alzheimer’s disease”. Then, we tried to classify all data pertaining to the pharmacological effects of MFH functional foods on memory in different animal models, methods, mechanisms, etc. The summarized results comprised a total of 28 plant species, 35 phytochemicals, and 9 TCM formulations of MFH resources with antiAD activities exhibited in various preclinical and five clinical studies (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5). The main MFH items that will be introduced are those, which are often used, such as “Monarch medicine” and clinical evidence, including Angelica acutiloba (Siebold & Zucc.) Kitag., Panax ginseng C.A. Mey., and Poriacocos (Schw.) Wolf. This review will provide further support for the basic and clinical research on MFH and the use of functional foods in a healthy lifestyle in the future.",
        "conclusion": "Historically, Chinese ancestors developed many kinds of TCM through long-term practice and summarized their application in treating disease . They also realized that many of these TCMs could be eaten as functional foods (TCM nutrition) in their daily lives, which reflects the theory of MFH . Since the 20th century, chronic diseases have become the main cause of global morbidity and mortality. A very important reason for this is the imbalance of nutrition and suboptimal lifestyle behaviors, leading to such diseases as AD . In recent years, limited by the complexity of AD pathology, new drugs targeting amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) or tau proteins have failed to show significant clinical benefits, such as ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: CAD106 (NCT01097096), ACC-001 (NCT01284387), and AFFITOPE AD02 (NCT01117818 CAD106) . Consequently, the development of new drugs and new treatment methods have encountered considerable obstacles and bottlenecks. Interestingly, some TCMs are used as functional foods with brain targets, nutritional benefits, and long-term applications, adjusting diet nutrition to prevent the occurrence of AD, such as Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl, Zingiber officinale Roscoe, and Panax ginseng C.A. Mey. (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Taking MFH substances as the primary functional foods can ensure the safety and therapeutic effect of functional food. At the same time, good social and economic benefits can also be obtained by using the cost and technical advantages of TCM, coupled with the progress of the modern food industry . Therefore, MFH foods are used as a dietary intervention to provide higher specialist guidance for AD. However, although pharmacological research and clinical research have been devoted to proving the safety and effectiveness of MFH items in treating AD, the MOAs of MFH and their active components against AD are still unclear . Fortunately, TCM transcriptomics, metabonomics, and protein omics, as well as TCM systematic pharmacology, are in full swing. Future research can combine multiomics and systems pharmacology to explore the pharmacokinetics of the multiple ingredients in these MFH substances . In addition, most studies on the mechanism and efficacy of MFH are still at the animal and cellular levels; therefore, clinical research is scarce. Future clinical research should be performed to discover novel antiAD agents of MFH foods. Moreover, given the diversity of AD pathology, MFH antiAD research should also focus on its multicomponent and multitarget mechanisms in a holistic way. MFH originated in China, but is now favored by people worldwide in the daily diet to prevent the occurrence and development of AD. The rapid development of modern science and technology should provide an advanced theory and a wider field of vision for explaining the advantages of traditional MFH theory in AD. Particularly in recent years, overcoming chronic diseases requires more basic and clinical research to develop new drugs. As a renewable and promising resource, MFH should be a resource to take ongoing effective measures to develop and produce new antiAD drugs or health care products."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is classically characterized by two major histopathological abnormalities: extracellular plaques composed of amyloid beta (Aβ) and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, it is of the utmost importance to develop disease-modifying therapeutics that tackle AD pathology in its early stages. Attenuation of hippocampal hyperactivity, one of the earliest neuronal abnormalities observed in AD brains, has emerged as a promising strategy to ameliorate cognitive deficits and abate the spread of neurotoxic species. This aberrant hyperactivity has been attributed in part to the dysfunction of voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channels, which are central mediators of neuronal excitability. Therefore, targeting Nav channels is a promising strategy for developing disease-modifying therapeutics that can correct aberrant neuronal phenotypes in early-stage AD. This review will explore the role of Nav channels in neuronal function, their connections to AD pathology, and their potential as therapeutic targets.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder classically characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates that disrupt synaptic function, ultimately culminating in synaptic decline and neurodegeneration . Current FDA-approved small-molecule therapeutics for AD include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists , which are effective in providing symptomatic relief but lack disease-modifying properties. FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies, such as aducanumab and lecanemab , show efficacy in the clearance of Aβ, but there is a lack of evidence that they convincingly slow AD progression among large clinical populations. Thus, there remains an unmet need for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics for AD. Accumulation of neurotoxic proteins in key brain regions induces neuronal deficits that are widely thought to be the cause of AD symptoms. The precise mechanisms of Aβ- and tau-mediated AD pathology remain to be elucidated, an issue which is further complicated by interpatient variability . Nonetheless, AD is defined by the accumulation of Aβ and tau deposits . Aβ deposition begins in the frontomedial and temporobasal areas, spreading then to the remaining neocortical regions . Tau accumulation is first observed in the entorhinal cortex and spreads successively into the hippocampus . While intricacies of the relationship between Aβ and tau seeding and accumulation remain elusive, several studies suggest that Aβ may facilitate the seeding of tau . The Aβ and tau proteins progressively accumulate at synapses, interrupting synaptic communication through the degeneration of dendritic spines , leading to axonal degeneration and eventual neuronal loss . These phenomena progressively hinder the function of the hippocampal circuit, inducing deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), two forms of synaptic plasticity widely thought to be the basis of progressive memory loss in AD .",
        "conclusion": "There remains a major need for AD therapeutics with disease-modifying properties. Therefore, elucidating the neuronal mechanisms that underlie AD progression is a critical step in the development of novel interventions. Hippocampal hyperactivity is one of the first neuronal phenotypes observed in AD patients, and it is linked to the onset of memory deficits as well progression of AD pathophysiology. Correction of this hyperactivity, therefore, is an attractive disease-modifying therapeutic strategy and has emerged as the focus of many recent investigations. While the complete roles of Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 throughout AD progression remain to be elucidated, their contributions to early-stage hyperactivity are under investigation and may prove critical to the development of disease-modifying AD therapeutics. Given their central roles in governing the excitability of these neuronal subtypes, functional modulation of Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to regulate hippocampal activity in early-stage AD, and their contributions to early-stage hyperactivity may prove critical to the development of disease-modifying AD therapeutics. In addition to pursuing traditional pharmacological approaches, Nav channel activity may be regulated through modulation of post-translational modifications or stable interactions with auxiliary proteins that alter channel activity. In the AD brain, there are numerous kinase signaling cascades and disease-related proteins that exhibit distinct functions and expression patterns during disease progression, several of which have established functional effects on Nav channels. In many cases, the functional consequences of these interactions are divergent among Nav isoforms. Therefore, functionally modulating Nav channels through altering their regulatory PTMs or protein complexes may provide the opportunity for the development of isoform-specific Nav channel therapeutics with improved specificity for diseased tissues."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most serious age-related neurodegenerative disease and causes destructive and irreversible cognitive decline. Failures in the development of therapeutics targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, principal proteins inducing pathology in AD, suggest a paradigm shift towards the development of new therapeutic targets. The gram-negative bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are attractive new targets for AD treatment. Surprisingly, an altered distribution of gram-negative bacteria and their LPS has been reported in AD patients. Moreover, gram-negative bacteria and their LPS have been shown to affect a variety of AD-related pathologies, such as Aβ homeostasis, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Moreover, therapeutic approaches targeting gram-negative bacteria or gram-negative bacterial molecules have significantly alleviated AD-related pathology and cognitive dysfunction. Despite multiple evidence showing that the gram-negative bacteria and their LPS play a crucial role in AD pathogenesis, the pathogenic mechanisms of gram-negative bacteria and their LPS have not been clarified. Here, we summarize the roles and pathomechanisms of gram-negative bacteria and LPS in AD. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of using gram-negative bacteria and gram-negative bacterial molecules as novel therapeutic targets and new pathological characteristics for AD.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the main causes of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disease causing cognitive decline and impairment of memory, language, and attention . Previous studies have demonstrated that amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau are pathological hallmarks and primary causes of AD . Medications targeting Aβ and tau have been developed to treat AD; however, they have not been effective in clinical trials. Therefore, changes in therapeutic targets are required, and upstream pathogenic contributors that affect Aβ and tau pathology are receiving increasing interest . Many studies regarding the relationships between microbes and AD have indicated microorganisms as one of the new therapeutic targets for AD . Namely, extensive changes in the microbiome occur in AD, and studies analyzing the intestinal microbiome in AD patients and animal models have provided interesting insights . Various sources of infection, such as fungi, viruses, and bacteria, are reportedly associated with AD . The occurrence of microbiome dysbiosis or infection of several species of toxic bacteria may contribute to AD pathogenesis by triggering strong inflammatory responses or participating in Aβ production . Surprisingly, systemic inflammatory responses due to bacterial infection may also continue, causing neuronal cell death and Aβ/tau accumulation, contributing to the development and progression of AD. The brains of AD patients contain 5–10 times more bacteria than healthy brains; differences in the distribution and composition of the bacteria have also been studied . In addition, it has been reported that the gram-negative bacteria can cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and contribute to neuroinflammation, Aβ accumulation, and tau hyperphosphorylation within the brain . In particular, several gram-negative bacteria, such as Proteobacteria and Chlamydophila pneumonia, have been reported to provoke strong systemic inflammation and contribute to AD pathogenesis . Furthermore, the byproducts of gram-negative bacteria, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), capsular proteins, fimbrillins and flagellins, can also penetrate the brain and affect neuroinflammation, and Aβ and tau pathology . LPS is a macromolecule mainly distributed in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and acts as a powerful endotoxin . The immune system responds with high sensitivity to LPS, high concentrations of which can cause sepsis and septic shock . Furthermore, sepsis caused by LPS is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and AD development . Interestingly, LPS concentration in the plasma of patients with AD is 3–6 times higher than normal; similarly, LPS concentration in the blood of AD animal models is approximately 3 times higher than normal . In AD, the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory immunomodulation is suggested to have a fatal effect on AD pathology . Furthermore, a vicious cycle involving infectious species and their products in the induction of AD pathology has been continually proposed as an ‘infection hypothesis’ that potentially provides interesting insights into AD pathology . These pieces of evidence suggest that LPS could not only be one of the upstream pathologic processes that either initiate or induce AD pathology, but also a promising therapeutic target for AD treatment. Despite accumulating evidence on the importance of gram-negative bacteria and their LPS in AD pathology, their pathogenic mechanisms have not been clarified. Therefore, we attempted to summarize the pathogenic roles of gram-negative bacteria and their LPS in AD pathology and discuss their potential as effective therapeutic targets for AD (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).",
        "conclusion": "The gram-negative bacteria and their LPS are detected in the CNS as well as in the periphery, and can trigger or accelerate AD pathology. We discuss the alterations and species of gram-negative bacteria in AD (Tables 1 and 2). The gram-negative bacteria can directly penetrate the CNS through various mechanisms (Fig. 1) and influence AD pathogenesis (Fig. 2). Moreover, several gram-negative bacteria are involved in microbiota dysbiosis, Aβ pathology, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration in AD. Furthermore, the impact of gram-negative bacterial byproducts on major AD pathologies suggests that the gram-negative bacteria are an essential therapeutic target for AD (Table 3). Importantly, gram-negative bacteria-derived LPS, which is present at high concentrations in AD patients, is a direct pathogenic factor (Fig. 4). The AD pathology-related localization of LPS within the CNS suggests that LPS has unique pathological roles in AD (Table 4). Moreover, LPS is directly involved in AD pathology, including neuroinflammation through microglial TLR4 and induction of neuronal cell death through neuronal TLR4. The ‘LPS cascade phenomenon’, which acts as an upstream molecule triggering AD pathogenesis or accelerating progression by engagement in various aspects of AD pathology, should be considered as a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment. As a novel therapeutic strategy for AD, the modulation of LPS-releasing gram-negative bacteria is receiving much attention (Table 5). Although the bacteria-targeting treatments, such as antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation, show potential for AD treatment, there are still concerns regarding their side effects and safety. In particular, potential side effects of the use of non-specific drugs that target bacteria indiscriminately should receive cautions. Therefore, it is important to categorize and characterize gram-negative bacteria that affect AD. Taken together, the gram-negative bacteria and their LPS are not only an upstream pathologic process which influences Aβ and tau pathology, but are also attractive targets for AD treatment. With no practical treatment for AD yet in development, the control of gram-negative bacteria and their LPS may be an excellent strategy to prevent the onset and progression of AD."

        "title": "Decoding Alzheimer's Disease With Depression: Molecular Insights and Therapeutic Target.",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to recognise predictive biomarkers and explore the promising therapeutic targets of AD with depression. We confirmed a positive correlation between AD and depression through MR Analysis. Through WGCNA analysis, we identified 1569 genes containing two modules, which were most related to AD. In addition, 1629 depressive DEGs were also identified. In these genes, 84 genes were shared by both AD and depression, which were screened by the Degree algorithm, MCC algorithm, and four machine learning algorithms. Two genes (ITGB5 and SPCS1) were confirmed as predictive biomarkers with AUC > 0.7. Furthermore, the nomogram indicated that ITGB5 and SPCS1 are good biomarkers in diagnosing AD with depression. Four drugs targeted at ITGB5 were determined by the DGIdb website. In conclusion, we identified two predictive biomarkers for AD with depression, thus providing promising therapeutic targets for AD with depression.",
        "year": "2025",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40074694/",
        "introduction": "The main characteristic of depression is a persistently low mood that persists for a long period of time, accompanied by decreased interest and loss of pleasure, often affecting the individual's work, school and social functioning. There are three grades of severity: mild, moderate, and severe. This study focused on major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is a highly prevalent mental illness characterised by a combination of emotional, anxiety, cognitive, sleep, and appetite symptoms lasting for more than 2 weeks . MDD is considered a leading contributor to global disability, impacting around 350 million individuals and resulting in more than 800,000 suicides annually . Additionally, MDD severely impairs function in patients and reduces quality of life, with a higher relapse rate compared to any other disease . AD is a classic neurodegenerative disorder with a strong genetic risk of about 60%–80% . AD is the main contributor to dementia, which is responsible for 50%–75% of dementia cases . As a common neurodegenerative disorder, AD poses a significant and escalating public health challenge worldwide, resulting in substantial consequences for both individuals and communities . Recent data has shown that the occurrence of dementia is projected to increase twofold in Europe and triple globally by the year 2050 . The hallmark biological indicators of AD are neurofibrillary tau pathology and deposition of beta amyloid . While there have been notable strides in biomarkers and amyloid imaging for AD , there still remains a lack of definitive diagnostic tests or biological markers for AD. The lifelong diagnosis of AD is based on clinical examination, causing great delays in identifying the condition and leading to unavoidable losses on both individual and societal levels . As we all know, the diagnosis of depression mainly depends on the depression scale. However, the depression scale has been questioned to some extent, and the key problem lies in the subjectivity of diagnosis. Depression is a heterogeneous disorder with different aetiologies and pathogenesis, and the symptoms and severity vary greatly in different stages and different people. When the heterogeneity of depression is ignored, there are great limitations and errors in the diagnostic results . MDD and AD are common in the elderly and often occur together , with about a quarter of people with AD who are also diagnosed with MDD . Unfortunately, because AD with depression still lacks specific diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines, the diagnosis and management of AD with depression are difficult. Therefore, the discovery of sensitive and specific predictive biomarkers for AD with depression is urgently required. Mendelian randomization is a statistical method that utilises genetic variation as an instrumental variable to infer causality between exposure factors and outcomes . Firstly, this study used MR analysis to investigate the causal relationship between AD and depression. It is well known that bioinformatics approaches provide powerful tools for understanding the intricate molecular networks and common pathophysiological mechanisms involved in complex diseases . By combining various omics data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, bioinformatics analyses can offer comprehensive insights into the causes, development, and treatment outcomes of diseases. In this study, we utilised a variety of bioinformatics methods and machine learning algorithms to explore the co‐occurrence of AD and depression with the goal of identifying potential early predictive biomarkers for AD in depression patients and understanding the immune mechanisms involved. The findings of this study can potentially facilitate the discovery of diagnostic markers for AD in depression.",
        "conclusion": "It is well known that depression often accompanies the development of AD . In this study, we investigated the causal relationship between AD and depression using MR. The results of the MR analysis showed a significant positive correlation between AD and depression. The patients suffering from AD with depression present a substantial challenge in clinic. The potential mechanisms remain unclear, and the resultant interventions are imperative. This study aims to offer novel insights into the biomarkers and therapeutic targets of AD with depression through bioinformatics analysis. We utilised bioinformatic analysis and machine learning methods to screen key targets and construct ROC curves and a nomogram to evaluate the diagnostic value of biomarkers. The most notable finding is that we identified two predictive genes (ITGB5 and SPCS1) and formed a nomogram for diagnosing AD with depression. In addition, we used the Genecards database, which contains many drugs, to explore therapeutic drugs targeted at identified genes. ITGB5 is a member of the integrin family, which are cell surface receptors that mediate cell‐extracellular matrix and cell–cell adhesion . Specifically, ITGB5 forms heterodimers with integrin alpha subunits to create functional integrin receptors, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes such as cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and immune response regulation . ITGB5 has been implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, cancer metastasis, and inflammation . Therefore, ITGB5 dysregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, making ITGB5 an important target for therapeutic intervention. To date, there is limited direct evidence linking ITGB5 to AD with depression. However, given the emerging understanding of the role of cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix interactions in neurodegenerative disorders and mood disorders , ITGB5, as a cell surface receptor involved in these processes, may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of AD with depression. ITGB5 plays a role in neuroinflammation by modulating the activation of glial cells, such as microglia , which are implicated in both AD and depression. In AD, microglial activation contributes to amyloid‐beta deposition and neurodegeneration , and microglia can sense depression‐related stressors and induce immune responses, resulting in depression . In depression individuals, microglia may become activated, releasing pro‐inflammatory cytokines and other molecules that can affect mood‐regulating circuits in the brain . Furthermore, overactivation of microglia disrupts neuroplasticity and synaptic remodelling , leading to depression and cognitive impairment. Therefore, ITGB5 may be a promising therapeutic target for AD with depression. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying ITGB5's dysregulation in AD with depression is worthy of further investigation, which could provide valuable insights into new therapeutic targets for complex neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. SPCS1 (Signal Peptide Peptidase Like 1) is a signal peptide peptidase‐like protein belonging to the membrane protein family, actively involved in intracellular protein processing pathways . The primary function is to cleave the signal peptides within the endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the accurate localisation of newly synthesised proteins to various cellular compartments. Additionally, SPCS1 is implicated in intracellular signalling transduction and protein degradation processes . In the pathogenesis of AD and depression, mounting evidence suggests an intimate association between aberrations in intracellular protein processing pathways and disease progression . In AD, the accumulation of misfolded proteins like β‐amyloid and tau can trigger ER stress and exacerbate neurodegeneration , while ER dysfunction can impair neuronal function and emotional regulation in depression . In this process, SPCS1 is able to help reduce the accumulation of toxic proteins, thereby offering neuroprotection . Although the precise mechanisms of SPCS1's involvement in AD with depression remain incompletely understood, its significance in intracellular protein processing pathways and association with these AD with depression has garnered considerable research interest. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms through which SPCS1 impacts the development of AD with depression. Immune regulation and inflammatory responses play key roles in the pathological mechanisms of AD with depression . Studies have shown that there is a significant inflammatory response in the brain tissue of AD mice, which is manifested by an increase in inflammatory mediators and the activation of immune cells . These mediators include tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), and IL‐6, which can induce neuronal damage, promote amyloid beta aggregation, and lead to loss of synaptic function . According to the results of immune cell infiltration, AD patients had a higher level of natural killer T cells, neutrophils and other immune cells, and a lower level of type 1 T helper cells, activated B cells and memory B cells, which are consistent with previous studies . In addition, ITGB5 showed a strong correlation with several immune cell types, particularly Natural Killer T cells (r = 0.7455, p < 0.01), suggesting ITGB5 might play a role in the migration and activation of immune cells, thereby influencing the immune response in AD with depression patients. In addition, SPCS1 showed a complex relationship with immune cell infiltration in AD, being positively correlated with 9 types of immune cells and negatively correlated with 8 types of other cells, indicating the potential role of SPCS1 in maintaining immune response balance. Notably, the negative correlation between SPCS1 and CD56dim natural killer (NK) cells (r = −0.6522, p < 0.01) suggests that SPCS1 might inhibit the activation or infiltration of NK cells, thereby affecting immune responses in the brain. Because NK cells are involved in the clearance of damaged or infected cells, a reduction in NK cell activity could lead to a shift toward adaptive immunity and potentially exacerbate inflammatory conditions, thus accelerating AD with depression progression. Moreover, the role of SPCS1 in protein synthesis may impact the expression of cytokines or other inflammatory mediators, which is crucial for understanding the role of SPCS1 in the neuroinflammation of AD with depression. In summary, comprehending inflammatory signalling mechanisms could facilitate the diagnosis of AD and the development of effective therapies. While our study provides novel insights, there are some limitations. We selected genes based on genes that were cross‐identified by four machine learning algorithms, each algorithm with its own characteristics. First, LASSO can address overfitting by selecting important variables, tending to select one and disregard the others, thus leading to an inaccurate result . Second, Random Forest methods can manage high‐dimensional data and mitigate overfitting by constructing multiple decision trees through random sampling and feature selection. However, its ensemble nature often impacts its interpretability, making it challenging to discern individual decision trees . Third, SVM‐RFE, a fusion of SVM and RFE, enhances interpretability by identifying crucial features while maintaining model performance. Yet, it may incur high computational costs, particularly for large datasets or datasets with numerous features, and requires careful parameter tuning . Fourth, GMM offers flexibility in modelling complex data distributions, which is suitable for datasets with multiple distinct distributions. However, its computational demands can be huge, especially with a large number of parameters, and its performance may decline in the presence of overlapping data distributions. In addition, there is only two datasets used for validation. Therefore, further basic experiments and clinical trials are essential to verify the outcomes. In this paper, we demonstrate a causal relationship between AD and depression through Mendelian randomization. Furthermore, we have recognised two candidate key genes (ITGB5 and SPCS1) through different bioinformatics analysis methods and machine learning algorithms. Meanwhile, we also noted that the proportion of immune cells in AD patients is abnormal. In conclusion, this study may provide promising diagnostic predictive biomarkers for patients suffering from AD with depression, which may also be a breakthrough point in exploring new treatments for AD with depression."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. There is a growing body of evidence that dysregulation in neuronal calcium (Ca2+) signaling plays a major role in the initiation of AD pathogenesis. In particular, it is well established that Ryanodine receptor (RyanR) expression levels are increased in AD neurons and Ca2+ release via RyanRs is augmented in AD neurons. Autophagy is important for removing unnecessary or dysfunctional components and long-lived protein aggregates, and autophagy impairment in AD neurons has been extensively reported. In this review we discuss recent results that suggest a causal link between intracellular Ca2+ signaling and lysosomal/autophagic dysregulation. These new results offer novel mechanistic insight into AD pathogenesis and may potentially lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets for treating AD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related brain disorder that causes progressive neurodegeneration predominantly in the cortical and hippocampal brain regions. Major hallmarks of AD are the progressive impairment of memory storage and accumulation of fibrillary amyloid plaques in patient’s brains. Despite decades of research and effort, there is still no effective disease-modifying treatment for AD. Although amyloid pathology is a hallmark and defining feature of AD, targeting amyloid pathways has been very challenging due to low efficacy and serious side effects. Therefore, it is important to explore alternative approaches for treating memory loss in AD . Increasing studies suggest that Ca2+ dysregulation in AD plays an important role in AD pathology and is associated with other AD abnormalities, such as excessive inflammation, increased ROS, impaired autophagy, neurodegeneration, and synapse and cognitive dysfunction . Autophagy is important for removing unnecessary or dysfunctional components and long-lived protein aggregates, and a substantial amount of evidence in both AD patients and AD animal models indicates autophagy dysregulation plays an important role in AD pathogenesis . Autophagy can also be regulated by intracellular Ca2+ signals arising from different organelles, including ER, mitochondria and lysosomes . The majority of Ca2+ release from the ER is mediated by two families of Ca2+-permeable channels, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyanRs). The role of InsP3Rs in regulation of autophagy had been intensively studied in non-excitable cells, and InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ signals have been suggested to be involved in both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on autophagy . Recently, the role of RyanR in regulating lysosomal acidification and autophagy is receiving greater attention. On another hand, some recent studies suggested that changes in lysosomal acidification may affect intracellular Ca2+ signaling by modulating activity of TRPML1 lysosomal Ca2+ channels . In this review, we will focus on emerging interplay between dysregulated Ca2+ signaling and dysfunction of the lysosomal/autophagic system in AD neurons.",
        "conclusion": "Dysregulation of intracellular neuronal Ca2+ signaling and impairment of neuronal autophagy are two well-established phenomenon observed in AD neurons. Until recently studies of these two signaling pathways proceeded largely independently of each other. However, several recent papers point to a causal connection between them. Some results suggest that defects in lysosomal acidification may contribute to Ca2+ signaling defects by causing an overactivation of lysosomal TRPML1 channels . Some data suggest that enhanced activity of RyanR may lead to defects in lysosomal acidification by affecting the activity of lysosomal V-ATPase . Our recent findings suggest that basal Ca2+ released by RyanR2 may control steady-state levels of autophagy via CaN-AMPK-ULK1 pathways and that overactivation of RyanR2 in AD may lead to the overstimulation of CaN and the inhibition of autophagic flux . Further studies will be needed to dissect relationships between intracellular Ca2+ dysregulation and autophagy in AD, but obtained results already offer some novel mechanistic insight and may potentially lead to the identification of novel therapeutic methods for treating AD and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders."

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting millions worldwide, with prevalence rates increasing with age (1–3). The disease significantly impacts cognitive functions, particularly memory, executive function, and visuospatial skills, leading to a progressive decline in the ability to perform daily activities (4, 5). The progression of AD can be categorized into three stages: preclinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s dementia, each with varying degrees of cognitive and functional impairment (1, 6). The pathological hallmarks of AD include amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and significant neuronal loss (7). Amyloid plaques are extracellular deposits of amyloid-beta peptides, while neurofibrillary tangles consist of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins within neurons, disrupting normal cell function (8, 9). These pathologies contribute to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and ultimately neuronal death, which are critical drivers of cognitive decline observed in AD patients (10, 11). Single-cell sequencing is a cutting-edge technology that allows for the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level, providing a detailed map of cellular diversity and function (4). This technique involves isolating single cells, amplifying their genetic material, and sequencing it to identify unique gene expression profiles (9). The ability to dissect the transcriptomes of individual cells provides unprecedented resolution in understanding cellular heterogeneity in complex tissues like the brain (8). In neuroimmune research, single-cell sequencing has become invaluable for identifying distinct cell types, states, and interactions within the brain’s immune landscape (12). This technology enables the detailed characterization of microglia, astrocytes, and other immune cells, revealing their roles in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (13). By mapping the cellular and molecular changes associated with AD, researchers can uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and develop strategies to modulate neuroimmune responses (14). In recent years, single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have significantly advanced our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Studies have identified new disease-associated microglial populations and other non-neuronal cell types that play crucial roles in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. For example, recent research has uncovered distinct microglial subpopulations with differential roles in amyloid-beta clearance and neuroinflammation (15, 16). Additionally, recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews have highlighted the potential of these technologies in identifying new biomarkers for AD (17, 18). Innovations in spatial transcriptomics, such as Visium and MERFISH, have enabled high-resolution mapping of gene expression in AD-affected brain regions, revealing how cellular interactions change in response to amyloid pathology (19). Furthermore, the integration of transcriptomics with other omic technologies, like proteomics, is providing a more comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms driving AD, offering new opportunities for biomarker discovery and therapeutic targeting (20, 21).",
        "conclusion": "Recent advancements in single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have significantly enhanced our understanding of AD. These technologies have revealed the complexity and heterogeneity of brain cell types, identifying distinct cellular subpopulations and specific gene expression profiles associated with AD. Key findings include the discovery of disease-associated microglial subpopulations and cell-type-specific regulatory elements linked to AD risk genes, which provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease and potential therapeutic targets (15, 16, 19, 43). Looking forward, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics are poised to drive new research paradigms and personalized therapeutic approaches for AD. By continuing to integrate these technologies with other omics data, researchers can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the disease, ultimately leading to the identification of novel therapeutic strategies. Collaboration, funding, and interdisciplinary efforts will be essential to advance this field and improve patient outcomes (20)."

However, this approach faces several limitations and challenges, including the need for a deep understanding of disease mechanisms, identifying and validating suitable drug targets, and requiring substantial computational resources and data infrastructure. Ethical, data privacy, and regulatory considerations, and the heterogeneity of patient populations and disease progression further complicate drug development and clinical implementation. Despite these challenges, the collaborative efforts in multi-target drug discovery and AI-driven approaches are promising for advancing neurodegenerative therapeutics. Although it may take decades for mRNA vaccine treatments to reach patients, US government funding initiatives for novel biotechnology research could accelerate their availability. Given the vast potential of this technology and its humanitarian impact, many new multi-target drug treatments are expected to arrive soon."

        "title": "Systematic post-translational modification genome wide identifies therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease: evidence from multi-cohort analysis.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rapid increase in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised concerns, given its profound effects on both society and the economy. Despite extensive research efforts in this area, there are no existing treatments that have the ability to change the progression of the disease. METHODS: To identify the distinct subtypes of AD, consensus clustering was employed. Following this, module genes were identified through the implementation of WGCNA. In addition, the investigation included the identification of hub genes through the application of machine learning. Ultimately, a thorough analysis was performed utilizing a methodical strategy to perform post-translational modification (PTM) genome wide. RESULTS: GO and KEGG analyses were conducted by examining of 21 different types of PTMs, revealing that the majority of these genes play key roles in the PTM pathways, as well as AD-related pathways. Correlation analysis revealed that these PTM were significantly correlated with gamma secretase activity, beta secretase activity, amyloid-beta 42, clinical dementia rating, Braak stage, plaque, and neurofibrillary tangle. Then, two distinct subtypes of PTM were identified, each characterized by unique clinical characteristic. By utilizing machine learning, we developed an PTM.score, and has shown impressive predictive capabilities for AD when tested against various datasets (brain AUC: 0.859, blood AUC: 0.898), indicating its potential utility in clinical settings for risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making. Moreover, our investigation led to the identification of two genes (TRIM47 and LNX1) that may represent potential drug targets for AD (brain tissues or blood samples). Research further indicated a potential correlation between TRIM47 and concentrations of CSF Aβ (OR 1.068 (1.029-1.108)), CSF p-tau (OR 1.315 (1.136-1.524)), and total hippocampal (OR 1.176 (1.058-1.307)). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study not only enhance our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of AD but also serve to inform and direct future initiatives in drug discovery. By focusing on TRIM47, the work paves the way for identifying innovative therapeutic strategies.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become the fifth leading cause of death globally . Among individuals aged 65 and older, the prevalence of AD is approximately 3.21 %. With increasing age, particularly in those aged 85 and above, the prevalence of AD rises sharply, reaching as high as 30 %−40 % . However, in stark contrast, the diagnosis and treatment rates for AD remain low . The etiology and pathogenesis of AD are not yet fully understood, so clinical diagnosis still relies on exclusion. Studies have shown that pathological changes associated with AD begin to manifest in the brain 10 to 20 years before symptoms appear. This finding indicates that a “window period” of over a decade exists between the onset of pathological changes and the emergence of symptoms. Early screening and intervention during this period are most effective. Currently, the primary therapeutic agents for AD in clinical practice fall into two major categories: the first is cholinesterase inhibitors, and the second is N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDA) antagonists . However, due to the complex nature of AD, which is influenced by multiple factors, currently available drugs can only delay disease progression and cannot reverse or halt its advancement. Thus, it is essential to explore and identify further key genes, along with understanding the mechanisms that govern their functions. Pathological changes in AD include β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (abnormal Tau protein aggregates), synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and brain atrophy . Tau protein participates in regulating neuronal functions such as signal transduction, neurodevelopment, and neural plasticity through mechanisms including mRNA alternative splicing and post-translational modifications . Tau protein undergoes multiple types of post-translational modifications (PTM), but these modifications produce differing biological effects . For instance, while excessive phosphorylation of tau initially exerts a protective role, its overall biological effect is detrimental. Modification types with negative effects also include glycosylation, glycation, acetylation, nitration, and SUMOylation. Targeted therapies for pathological tau protein have become a current research focus. Fyn is a tyrosine kinase that becomes hyperactivated during AD pathogenesis, potentially leading to tau protein phosphorylation at tyrosine 18, formation of toxic Aβ oligomers, and elevated levels of cellular prions . The small-molecule anticancer drug AZD0530, a Fyn inhibitor, demonstrated activity in suppressing tau protein aggregation in transgenic mouse models. A Phase 1b clinical trial demonstrated that AZD0530 is highly safe and well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate AD . Abnormal post-translational modifications of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) are key factors affecting APP metabolism and leading to the pathological process of Aβ deposition. These modifications regulate APP metabolic processes such as cleavage and degradation . Research has found that HRD1 protein levels are significantly reduced in the cerebral cortex of AD patients, leading to APP accumulation. HRD1 can bind to APP and promote its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby reducing Aβ production . The C-terminal region of APP contains multiple ubiquitinoylation sites. Ubiquitinoylation is involved in APP degradation, which requires the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Impairment of the UPS increases the pathological accumulation of toxic proteins, affecting the degradation of both APP and Aβ . Simultaneously, Aβ inhibits proteasome activity, thereby impairing the multivesicular body (MVB) sorting pathway, creating a vicious cycle between Aβ deposition and UPS dysfunction . In summary, post-translational modifications of APP and Tau play a crucial role in the deposition process of Aβ and Tau. Research into the associated regulatory mechanisms will provide a solid basis for selecting drug targets in AD. Despite significant progress in the field, a thorough understanding of the relationship between PTM and AD continues to be a challenge. The intricate connection between PTM and changes in clinical characteristics associated with AD necessitates further detailed investigation to clarify these associations. To address these existing knowledge gaps, we undertook an integrative approach by analyzing 21 distinct types of PTM. Our goal was to uncover potential biomarkers that could enhance the diagnosis and understanding of AD. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, we developed an innovative metric known as PTM.score aimed at forecasting efficacy in AD patients. Our research demonstrated that PTM.score exhibits remarkable effectiveness in predicting clinical outcomes for individuals diagnosed with AD. In the context of a genome-wide analysis, TRIM47 has been identified as a critical molecular component that plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. This discovery marks TRIM47 as a factor that had not been previously recognized in relation to AD, highlighting its importance in the disease's underlying mechanisms. Consequently, TRIM47 represents a promising new target for therapeutic interventions aimed at treating this debilitating condition.",
        "conclusion": "Bioinformatics analysis has rapidly advanced over recent decades and been applied to numerous diseases, uncovering novel biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment while revealing the complex pathogenic mechanisms underlying certain conditions. However, previous studies on AD have typically relied on single datasets. This research combines and analyzes 8 multicenter datasets collected from the GEO database, identifying AD-associated subtypes. Subsequently, a series of subtype-based integrated analyses were conducted, including DEG, GO, and KEGG enrichment analyses, WGCNA analysis, and machine learning analysis. The final key genes were validated using other GEO datasets. Finally, MR analysis was performed on the key genes. Collectively, these efforts identified potential AD candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of AD. First, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs between subtypes were predominantly enriched in synaptic function, with key module genes predominantly associated with learning and memory, processes closely linked to AD pathogenesis. Additionally, studies indicate that the MAPK signaling pathway is activated in susceptible brain regions of AD patients and contributes to disease progression, suggesting MAPKs as potential therapeutic targets for AD . Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis indicates that DEGs participate in diverse biological processes and exhibit distinct molecular functions. Collectively, Alterations in biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, and pathways likely contribute significantly to the development and progression of AD. These changes are interconnected and can influence one another, ultimately leading to the neurodegenerative symptom’s characteristic of this condition. Understanding the intricate relationships between these various factors is essential for gaining insight into the mechanisms underlying AD and could be pivotal in identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Previous studies have demonstrated that the immune system plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of AD . As effector cells of the innate immune system within the CNS, microglia perform immune surveillance, recognizing exogenous and endogenous CNS injuries and initiating immune responses. They provide nutritional support to neuronal cell bodies and axons, thereby ensuring brain tissue repair and maintaining cerebral homeostasis . During AD progression, microglia can phagocytose amyloid beta and clear damaged neurons. However, they may also exhibit pro-inflammatory activity while simultaneously impairing their own clearance mechanisms . Neutrophils represent the initial line of defense by being the first type of immune cells to be attracted to areas experiencing inflammation. Their primary role in host defense is multifaceted, as they engage in critical activities such as phagocytosis, where they engulf and digest pathogens. Additionally, neutrophils contribute to the immune response through degranulation, a process wherein they release antimicrobial substances stored in their granules to combat infections. Furthermore, they can form neutrophil extracellular traps, which are web-like structures composed of DNA and proteins that trap and neutralize microbial invaders. These combined functions underscore the vital importance of neutrophils in the body's immune response to harmful stimuli. Infiltrating neutrophils have been detected in brain tissue from AD patients and AD transgenic animal models . In two AD mouse models (5xFAD and 3xTg-AD mice), neutropenia induced by Ly-6G or LY-6C antibody treatment significantly reduced amyloid burden and microglial activation. It also improved mouse performance in the Y-maze spontaneous alternation task and conditioned fear test, indicating that neutrophils promote pathological progression in AD . This is consistent with our results, patients categorized with a PTM.cluster.A and high PTM.score group displayed a immune cell infiltration that was more actively engaged, which corresponded with a poor clinical characteristic. Then, by integrating different categories of genes, including DEGs, module genes, and PTM-related genes, 36 hub genes were identified (RNF175, PRMT8, UCHL1, GABARAPL1, UBE2V2, UBE2E2, ZDHHC23, LNX1, SMYD2, B4GALT6, HECW1, PELI3, ACACB, RNFT2, USP11, TRIM37, TRIM36, RNF41, UCHL5, B3GNT1, ZDHHC22, GOT2, DTX3L, LONRF2, RFPL2, OXCT1, HERC1, OTUD7B, RNF128, PDGFRB, RNF135, UHRF1, TRIM47, OGDHL, ZNRF3, and S100A8). Among them, research by Gong et al. revealed that UCHL1 protein levels are reduced in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD . Furthermore, the study found that downregulation of UCHL1 promotes tau protein phosphorylation, while increased degradation of UCHL1 protein was observed to cause greater neuronal damage . In the frontal cortex of AD patients, UCHL1 is the primary protein affected by oxidative damage, with oxidatively modified UCHL1 exhibiting a 20–60 % loss of hydrolase activity. Studies on AD have revealed that exogenous supplementation of wild-type UCHL1 protein can restore damaged synaptic function and learning capacity in APP/PS1 transgenic AD mouse models . Finally, TRIM47 could play a crucial role in the disease's progression and might be a valuable biomarker for assessing. The TRIM protein family comprises over 70 RING-domain-containing proteins that primarily function as E3 ligases in the ubiquitination process. TRIM proteins are essential in the regulation of a variety of cellular physiological activities. These proteins significantly influence mRNA localization, which is critical for the proper expression of genes, ensuring that the mRNA reaches the appropriate cellular locations for translation . Additionally, TRIM proteins are involved in autophagy, the process by which cells degrade and recycle cellular components, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis . Moreover, TRIM proteins have a role in programmed cell death pathways, such as proptosis and apoptosis, which are vital for normal development and the elimination of damaged cells. They also participate in the regulation of the cell cycle and mitosis, ensuring that cells divide correctly and that genetic material is accurately distributed to daughter cells. In response to DNA damage, TRIM proteins help initiate repair mechanisms, thereby safeguarding genomic stability. Furthermore, these proteins are implicated in the cellular response to viral infections, where they can modulate the immune response and enhance the clearance of pathogens. TRIM proteins also activate various immune pathways and can influence inflammatory processes, contributing to the body's response to infection and injury. Overall, the multifunctional roles of TRIM proteins underscore their importance in maintaining cellular integrity and responding to environmental challenges. TRIM proteins play a crucial role in the regulation of essential proteins within various signaling pathways. They achieve this by functioning as ubiquitinated effectors and ubiquitin-like modifiers, which are integral in maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating key biological processes . Additionally, the TRIM family of proteins has garnered attention for their potential as biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis in cancer . Researchers have actively evaluated these proteins to assess their utility in identifying malignancies at earlier stages, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. Our findings should be interpreted in light of several limitations. The expression of key genes remains to be validated across various biological levels, including mRNA, cellular, and protein levels. To establish a comprehensive understanding, further in vivo and in vitro experiments are essential. These additional investigations will help elucidate the signaling pathways that may be involved with TRIM47 in the context of AD. Moreover, while there is a significant correlation between elevated TRIM47 expression and poor prognosis in AD, the nature of its relationship with specific clinical and pathological parameters, such as gender, age, ethnicity, smoking history, and the stage of the disease, has yet to be clarified. This gap in understanding signifies the need for more detailed research. Lastly, to bolster the reliability and generalizability of the findings, it is crucial to expand the sample size and to involve multiple research centers in future studies. Such measures will enhance the credibility of the results and contribute to a more robust assessment of these important factors in AD research. In summary, a thorough examination was conducted to identify possible drug targets within PTM associated with AD using integrated bioinformatics approaches. This research offers genetic information that highlights the possible therapeutic advantages of focusing on TRIM47 for the treatment of AD. Consequently, a detailed investigation of TRIM47 in the context of AD enhances our understanding of the disease's pathogenesis and suggests effective treatment strategies."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder predominantly affecting the elderly, characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and functional impairment. While hallmark pathological features include extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, increasing evidence points to chronic neuroinflammation as a key driver of disease progression. Among inflammatory mechanisms, the activation of the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome in microglia plays a pivotal role by amplifying neuroinflammatory cascades, exacerbating synaptic dysfunction, and accelerating neuronal loss. This review examines the molecular underpinnings of AD with a focus on NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation, detailing the crosstalk between Aβ, tau pathology, and innate immune responses. Finally, we highlight emerging therapeutic strategies targeting NLRP3 inflammasome activation as promising avenues for mitigating neuroinflammation and slowing AD progression.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, primarily affecting the elderly and manifesting as progressive cognitive impairment. Its clinical symptoms commonly include memory loss, confusion, mood disturbances, and difficulties in reasoning, ultimately resulting in a significant decline in an individual’s quality of life. Despite decades of intensive research, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD remain incompletely understood. While various hypotheses have been proposed and debated, one consistent observation is the presence of key misfolded proteins in the brains of individuals with AD. These hallmark features include extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which arise from the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein . The accumulation of these pathological proteins induces cellular stress, triggering a cascade of neuroinflammatory responses. Among these responses, the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), plays a central role. These cytokines are activated through the assembly of the inflammasome complex, a multimeric structure composed of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), an adaptor protein, and the effector enzyme pro-caspase-1. In the brain, PRRs (the essential components of the innate immune system, responsible for recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns) are primarily expressed by microglia, macrophages, astrocytes, and, to a lesser extent, oligodendrocytes and are located either on the cell membrane (e.g., Toll-like receptors, TLRs) or within the cytoplasm (e.g., NOD-like receptors, NLRs) . Upon activation, NLRs initiate the assembly of inflammasomes, which are cytosolic multiprotein complexes. These inflammasomes facilitate the activation of pro-inflammatory caspases, particularly caspase-1, leading to the maturation and secretion of key inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 . The activation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a tightly regulated, multistep process that occurs in a defined sequence. The first phase, known as priming, is followed by an activation step involving post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation. During priming, signaling through cytokine receptors or TLRs activates NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus to drive the transcription and translation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. At this stage, NLRP3 remains in an autoinhibited state. A second signal, such as ATP, potassium efflux, or lysosomal damage, is required to relieve this inhibition and promote the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. This activation is facilitated by post-translational modifications of NLRP3, such as phosphorylation, and by its interaction with NEK7 (NIMA-related kinase 7), a critical regulator that binds NLRP3 to promote inflammasome assembly. These processes drive the conformational changes required for full inflammasome activation . The NLRP3 inflammasome has been the most studied, and we heavily target its discussion in this review. Experimental models have demonstrated that various components of AD pathology, including Aβ plaques and tau tangles, can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. In this review, we explore the molecular mechanisms by which these pathological stressors trigger inflammasome activation, discuss their role in AD progression, and examine potential therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating inflammasome activity to slow or prevent disease advancement.",
        "conclusion": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder driven by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation, with the NLRP3 inflammasome playing a central role in disease progression. This review highlights how Aβ aggregates and hyperphosphorylated tau trigger NLRP3 activation in microglia, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18 that exacerbate synaptic dysfunction, impair Aβ clearance, and accelerate neuronal loss. The resulting neuroinflammatory cascade, amplified by systemic inflammation and genetic factors, such as APOE ε4, establishes a self-perpetuating cycle that links proteinopathy to immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, underscoring the complexity of AD pathogenesis. Therapeutic targeting of the NLRP3 inflammasome offers a promising strategy to mitigate AD pathology. Small molecule inhibitors (e.g., NT-0796), natural compounds (e.g., epigallocatechin-3-gallate), and advanced approaches like gene therapy and nanotechnology demonstrate potential in reducing inflammation, enhancing neuronal health, and slowing cognitive decline. By disrupting this inflammatory cycle, these interventions address both the upstream triggers and downstream consequences of AD, paving the way for innovative treatments. Continued research into these mechanisms and therapeutic modalities is essential to transform AD management and improve patient outcomes."

        "title": "Inflamma-MicroRNAs in Alzheimer's Disease: From Disease Pathogenesis to Therapeutic Potentials.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of senile dementia. Although AD research has made important breakthroughs, the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear, and specific AD diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies are still lacking. Recent studies have demonstrated that neuroinflammation is involved in AD pathogenesis and is closely related to other health effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous short sequence non-coding RNAs that indirectly inhibit translation or directly degrade messenger RNA (mRNA) by specifically binding to its 3' untranslated region (UTR). Several broadly expressed miRNAs including miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-155, have now been shown to regulate microglia/astrocytes activation. Other miRNAs, including miR-126 and miR-132, show a progressive link to the neuroinflammatory signaling. Therefore, further studies on these inflamma-miRNAs may shed light on the pathological mechanisms of AD. The differential expression of inflamma-miRNAs (such as miR-29a, miR-125b, and miR-126-5p) in the peripheral circulation may respond to AD progression, similar to inflammation, and therefore may become potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Moreover, inflamma-miRNAs could also be promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment. This review provides insights into the role of inflamma-miRNAs in AD, as well as an overview of general inflamma-miRNA biology, their implications in pathophysiology, and their potential roles as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",
        "year": "2021",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34776873/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) (Mangialasche et al., 2010). Its pathological features include neuroinflammatory plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are caused by abnormal deposits of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-Tau) proteins, respectively (Sun B. L. et al., 2018). The clinical manifestations of AD include cognitive dysfunction, psychological abnormalities, and an inability to perform simple everyday tasks that require some degree of cognitive acuity (Jacobs et al., 2018). The mechanisms that drive AD pathogenesis have not yet been fully elucidated. However, several hypotheses have been proposed, including the cholinergic neuron hypothesis, the Aβ toxicity hypothesis, and the Tau hypothesis (Ballard et al., 2011), among which the Aβ toxicity hypothesis is the most generally accepted. Aβ aggregation, especially Aβ42, is currently recognized as the main mediator of AD pathogenesis due to its ability to assemble into insoluble toxic fibrils that aggregate to form a neurotoxic β-fold lamellar structure. These structures progressively develop into neuritic plaques, which is an important driver of AD pathogenesis (Kim J. et al., 2009; Benilova et al., 2012). Aβ is thus considered a neurotoxic protein that activates complement and microglia and accelerates cell death through inflammatory responses (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017). Additionally, gliosis has been identified around senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (Terada et al., 2001). Aβ can also stimulate microglia to release inflammatory factors with strong neurotoxicity and promote the occurrence of inflammatory responses (Lueg et al., 2015). The onset and development of AD may thus result from the activation of inflammatory responses in the brain (Hansen et al., 2018). The potent immune response that follows Aβ stimulation may result in an indiscriminate damage of healthy nerve tissue, thus resulting in nerve injury and neuronal death (Ceccom et al., 2014). Moreover, inflammatory cytokines and lymphocytes entering the brain through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) can also trigger an inflammatory response in AD patients, and these pathological mechanisms are likely related to the effects of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (Minogue et al., 2014; Solberg et al., 2014). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small endogenous non-coding RNAs approximately 18–25 nt in length (Hombach and Kretz, 2016). By interacting with the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of target messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNAs degrade mRNA or inhibit protein translation and exert a negative regulatory effect. In addition to inhibiting gene expression, miRNA can also enhance gene expression, and its binding site in the target mRNA is not always limited to the 3′ UTR (Baek et al., 2008; Selbach et al., 2008). The specific expression of miRNA in immune cells suggests its role in regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and function of immune cells (Essandoh et al., 2016). Innate immunity is the first line of attack against bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, and miRNA plays an important role in regulating innate immunity (Kumar and Bot, 2017). Recent studies have shown that miR-155, miR-146, and miR-223 play an important role in the regulation of acute inflammatory responses induced by pathogens via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Vegh et al., 2013). To study the regulatory role of miRNA in innate immunity, Taganov et al. (2006) examined the expression of 200 miRNAs in the THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cell line in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, and found that miR-146, miR-132, and miR-155 were upregulated in LPS-treated cells as compared to untreated cell. Interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) are important adaptive molecules downstream of the TLR signaling pathway, which can cause the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activated protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors, leading to increased cytokine release (Ghosh and Dass, 2016; Strickson et al., 2017). MiR-146a has a binding site on IRAK1 and TRAF6, and exerts a negative regulatory effect on this pathway (Williams et al., 2008). Interferon (INF)-γ/β can induce the upregulation of miR-155 in macrophages through autocrine and paracrine pathways of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (O’connell et al., 2007). MiR-155 also promotes the expression of TNF-α, suggesting that it plays a positive role in regulating the release of inflammatory factors in the innate immune response (Pedersen et al., 2009). miRNAs are also involved in adaptive immune responses such as immune cell activation, clonal proliferation, and antigen presentation. The upregulation of miR-181a can enable T cells to recognize inhibitory antigen peptides as active antigen peptides and enhance T cell signal transduction (Li et al., 2007). MiR-150, which is specifically expressed in mature lymphocytes, has been linked to the process of B cell differentiation. High expression of miR-150 in the spleen and thymus inhibits the differentiation of primary B cells into proprecursor B cells, thus affecting the formation of mature B cells (Zhou et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2018). However, miR-150 did not affect the formation of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, granulocytes, or macrophages (Lin et al., 2008). Several studies have confirmed that some miRNAs are involved in the regulation of inflammation, among which the most common ones include miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-155. Therefore, the term “inflamma-miRs” was coined to refer to these miRNAs (Quinn and O’neill, 2011). Further, additional studies have progressively linked miRNAs to the neuroinflammatory signaling, including NF-κB signaling (Amjad et al., 2019), TLR signaling pathway (Paschon et al., 2016), B cell receptor signaling (Borbet et al., 2021), and Jak/Stat signaling (Zhang M. et al., 2013). Inflammation has been associated with all stages of AD pathogenesis, and the mechanisms that drive the inflammatory response intricately interact with other processes that jointly damage the nervous system and promote the onset and progression of AD. Therefore, the inflammatory response is not a passive system triggered by senile plaques and neuronal tangles during AD progression but rather an equally important pathogenic factor (Zhang B. et al., 2013). In this review, we summarized the most recent evidence for the involvement of inflamma-miRs in modulating the proinflammatory response in AD and further discussed the potential of circulating inflamma-miRs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression, as well as the possibility of treating AD by regulating the expression of inflamma-miRs.",
        "conclusion": "Pathological neuroinflammation is among the most important mechanisms of AD pathogenesis. Therefore, understanding the specific molecular processes that drive AD-associated neuroinflammation will undoubtedly facilitate the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to ameliorate the social burden of AD. Previous studies have reported that miRNAs can regulate neuroinflammatory signals. Some inflamma-miRNAs (e.g., miR-146a and miR-155) may be involved in several pathologic processes of AD and have been shown to play a central role in the control of inflammation. Additionally, inflamma-miRNAs reportedly exhibit significant differential expression in the peripheral circulation (plasma/serum and CSF) of AD patients. Therefore, miRNAs are promising biomarkers for AD diagnosis and prognosis, as well as potential targets for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, the induction or inhibition of inflamma-miRNAs may improve CNS tissue damage following AD-related neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, although some progress has been made in understanding the role of inflamma-miRNAs in neuroinflammation, multiple areas warrant future investigation. First, the mechanisms controlling miRNA levels and stability in neuroinflammatory signaling must be determined, including the processes by which mature miRNAs are degraded or cleared. Second, the ability of multiple miRNAs to target combinatorially a common pathway should be assessed. For instance, miR-126-3p, miR-146a, and miR-29 may synergistically modulate inflammation and innate immune responses by targeting NF-κB pathway. Third, miRNAs are being considered as a novel type of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for AD. The improvement in sensitivity and specificity could definitely promote the practical application of miRNAs as important biomarkers."

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a highly degenerative neurological disorder, in which the patient suffers from tremendous memory deficits . Based on several epidemiological studies, AD currently affects over 47 million people worldwide . The pathophysiology of AD (particularly amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and its genetic drivers have been extensively explored recently . However, thus far, the precise pathogenesis of AD remains unknown, and no effective prevention and/or treatment methods exist for AD . Thus, specific therapeutic targets for AD are urgently needed. The GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database consists of microarray, sequencing, and high-throughput functional genomic datasets . Our goal was to search for hub genes and potential molecular mechanisms related to AD using bioinformatics. To that end, we retrieved AD versus normal tissue microarray data from the GEO databases and performed enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, as well as LASSO regression analyses to screen for principal AD-related genes, which were verified using ELISA assay. Hence, we provided a basis for the generation of new highly efficacious anti-AD drugs that can specifically target the underlying mechanism(s) of AD pathogenesis.",
        "conclusion": "Multiple studies demonstrated associations between numerous genes and AD . Nevertheless, early diagnosis and treatment of AD remains challenging. Hence, it is both urgent and necessary to develop targeted therapeutics that can either reduce or completely relieve AD symptoms. Herein, 416 DEGs were identified as potentially significant to AD pathogenesis. Enrichment analysis of DEGs demonstrated that they particularly contributed to extracellular space, respiratory chain complex II assembly, and calcium-dependent protein binding. Furthermore, three principal AD-specific genes were revealed, namely, IL-1β, CXCR4, and TAC1. Based on our ELISA assay, we further verified that the IL-1β and CXCR4 expressions were markedly upregulated in AD patients versus normal subjects. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) family is a crucial mediator of innate immunity and contributes to the inflammatory response of most cells and organs . Aberrant signaling by members of the IL-1R family is also associated with multiple autoinflammatory and degenerative diseases . Additionally, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a member of the IL-1 family, is also associated with chronic inflammation . Prior reports suggest that IL-1β not only participates in AD development but also serves as a key mediator of neuroinflammation . Griffin et al. observed that IL-1β promotes β-amyloid precursor protein generation, resulting in the synthesis and deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients. Likewise, Li et al. also reported that IL-1β is involved in tau phosphorylation, which, in turn, participates in key pathogenic processes. Chemokines are a large family of cytokines known for their small size (8–10 kDa). It can be divided into four categories, namely, CXC, CC, C, and CX3C, based on the positioning of the initial 2 cysteines . CXCR4, on the other hand, is vital for cellular development, hematopoiesis, organogenesis, and vascularization . Parachikova et al. reported that CXCR4 signaling can greatly enhance learning and memory and may be essential to AD pathogenesis. Similarly, Bonham et al. demonstrated that the expression of microglial genes was associated functionally with CXCR4 and is often dysregulated in neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, Gavriel et al. revealed that suppression of the CXCR4 axis can markedly augment cognitive/memory abilities, attenuate neuroinflammation, and alleviate AD symptomologies. There are several limitations to our study. Firstly, two key genes identified in this study have not been validated in a study population. Hence, additional large-scale verification investigations are warranted to fully explore the mechanism(s) underlying AD and identify relevant genes that can be targeted for anti-AD therapy. In summary, the present study demonstrates that IL-1β and CXCR4 are closely related to the occurrence and progression of AD. These two genes and associated signalling are excellent potential candidates for targeted anti-AD therapy. Our study may provide novel insights into possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent, progressive disorder affecting millions of people. Currently, the therapeutics for AD only treat the symptoms. Although they have been used to discover new products of interest for this disease, mammalian models used to investigate the molecular determinants of this disease are often prohibitively expensive, time-consuming and very complex. On the other hand, cell cultures lack the organism complexity involved in AD. Given the highly conserved neurological pathways between mammals and invertebrates, Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a powerful tool for the investigation of the pathophysiology of human AD. Numerous models of both Tau- and Aβ-induced toxicity, the two prime components observed to correlate with AD pathology and the ease of performing RNA interference for any gene in the C. elegans genome, allow for the identification of multiple therapeutic targets. The effects of many natural products in main AD hallmarks using these models suggest promising health-promoting effects. However, the way in which they exert such effects is not entirely clear. One of the reasons is that various possible therapeutic targets have not been evaluated in many studies. The present review aims to explore shared therapeutical targets and the potential of each of them for AD treatment or prevention.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-dependent, progressive disorder affecting millions of people . Although the cause of AD has not been fully elucidated, its histopathological hallmarks include the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of Tau microtubule protein in the hippocampus . Some of the therapeutics for AD that have been developed only treat the symptoms. Thus, there is a lack of effective treatments and medications that completely cure or delay progression of the disease. Therefore, more research on both the disease’s causes and its treatment is urgently needed. This, in part, would require adequate animal models . Natural products from living organisms, which contain wide and diverse ranges of chemical compounds, can be used as sources of new AD therapeutics, and might even play significant roles in drug discovery . C. elegans offers several particular advantages for the investigation of disorders of the nervous system. Thus, the use of C. elegans to study the beneficial effects of natural products on AD might provide a promising paradigm. For this reason, the present review aims to collect the main aspects of the pathogenesis and etiology of the disease and the characteristics of C. elegans as a model organism and, particularly, as a model of AD. All with the subsequent objective of deepening our understanding of the effects of many natural products on the main AD hallmarks shown by AD C. elegans models, and how they exert such effects.",
        "conclusion": "The present review aimed to explore the targets shared by natural products investigating AD treatment or prevention, based on research using C. elegans as a model organism. In recent years, a wide variety of natural products have been tested in transgenic C. elegans models, reflecting the great potential of this model for the discovery of neuroprotective products. Most of the tested product showed certain protective effects in terms of phenotypic changes, including both behavioral changes and the accumulation of protein aggregates. These assays reveal that phenotypic screening continues to be very useful for discovering new bioactive compounds. The possible effects of oxidative stress have been explored, but it remains to be elucidated if this is truly involved in the initiation and progression of the disease, or if it is a consequence. Other aspects studied include the role of cell signaling pathways. In this sense, the use of strains with knocked out genes has helped, but the use of RNAi offers more interesting advantages because it allows the direct investigation of the role of these pathways in AD models. In contrast, inflammation-related mechanisms, mitochondrial biology, neurotransmitter imbalances and proteostasis mechanisms, including unfolded protein response participants and autophagy, were investigated in a small number of studies. Since all of these are said to play a role in the pathology of AD, the interest and increase in the number of studies evaluating them is clear. On the other hand, except for one study, all research has been based on the C. elegans expression of human Aβs, so there is a bias towards the amyloid pathway. Therefore, it is necessary to perform new assays in new models of tauopathy, considering the failures in the clinical trials of drugs targeting this pathway and the reported associations between NFT levels and cognitive function. In addition, there are a lack of studies evaluating the possible effects of products after the pathological process has started, and it would be very interesting to explore the possibility of reversing the disease, at least in its earlier phases. Finally, it is important to underline the differences between humans and C. elegans, from pathology to the metabolism of the tested products. For this reason, research based on C. elegans should be complementary, rather than an alternative approach to the use of mammals. Therefore, the evidence obtained from worms must be validated in mammalian systems. Lastly, it is important to consider that curcumin, EGCG, gossypol and resveratrol have been considered nuisance compounds or “pan assay interference compounds (PAINS)” by Baell et al. , because such compounds frequently hitter in biological assays causing important problems in drug discovery research. This is due to these compounds modulating bioactivity through mechanisms of action considered undesirable because they generally cause cellular injury, but with an inherent lack of specificity. Consequently, they would interfere with cell assay results. The possible “undesirable” mechanisms exerted by PAINS include nonspecific electrophilicity, colloidal aggregation, redox cycling, membrane perturbation and chelation. The cellular injury derived from the mentioned mechanisms is in line with the concept “cytotoxicity burst”. This phenomenon occurs at relatively high compound concentrations and implies a set of cellular activities that are thought to result from the activation of multiple stress responses as opposed to originating from the activation of a specific molecular target . As shown, many compounds evaluated in AD C. elegans models activate cell signaling pathways involved in certain stress responses, which could be a consequence of cellular injury. Moreover, many of the tested natural products contain a mixture of substances which can share substructures with the PAINS identified to date. In addition, some of the substances present in them are uncharacterized. Therefore, many natural products are susceptible to interference by all the aforementioned mechanisms of action; therefore, these products should be explored in future studies. Likewise, testing the effects of these products at multiple concentrations, as well as the prefractionation of the extracts, have been proposed as potential solutions to these problems ."

        "title": "Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibition in Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "abstract": "Cognitive disorders and psychiatric pathologies, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Major depressive disorder (MDD), represent a considerable health burden, impacting millions of people in the United States and worldwide. Notably, comorbidities of MDD and anxiety are prevalent in the early stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is the preceding phase of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). The symptoms of MDD and anxiety affect up to 80% of individuals in the advanced stages of the neurodegenerative conditions. Despite overlapping clinical manifestations, the pathogenesis of AD/ADRD and MDD remains inadequately elucidated. Until now, dozens of drugs for treating AD/ADRD have failed in clinical trials because they have not proven beneficial in reversing or preventing the progression of these neuropsychiatric indications. This underscores the need to identify new drug targets that could reverse neuropsychiatric symptoms and delay the progress of AD/ADRD. In this context, phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) arises as a primary enzyme in the modulation of cognition and mood disorders, particularly through its enzymatic action on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and its downstream anti-inflammatory pathways. Despite the considerable cognitive and antidepressant potential of PDE4 inhibitors, their translation into clinical practice is hampered by profound side effects. Recent studies have focused on the effects of PDE4 and its subtype-selective isoform inhibitors, aiming to delineate their precise mechanistic contributions to neuropsychiatric symptoms with greater specificity. This review aims to analyze the current advances regarding PDE4 inhibition-specifically the selective targeting of its isoforms and elucidate the therapeutic implications of enhanced cAMP signaling and the consequent anti-inflammatory responses in ameliorating the symptomatology associated with AD and ADRD.",

        "introduction": "Neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) represent a significant public health challenge, impacting millions of individuals in the United States and worldwide. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, memory deficits influence an estimated 55 million individuals globally, with AD accounting for 60% to 70% of these cases . The continuum of AD has three phases: preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, and dementia due to AD, i.e., AD and related dementia (ADRD) . Neuropsychiatric manifestations, including depression and anxiety, are frequently observed in AD patients, beginning as early as the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase and affecting upwards of 80% of individuals in the advanced stages of AD . AD and related dementia is a terminal stage of neurodegenerative disease that deteriorates memory and cognitive function, leading to the progressive decline of problem-solving ability, personality changes, and even death . MDD is recognized as one of the most important symptoms of AD and ADRD worldwide, with an estimated 280 million individuals affected . Although AD and MDD exhibit overlapping clinical features, the underlying pathogeneses remain to be clarified. Current pharmacological interventions aimed at preventing the progression of memory decline have limited efficacy and cannot improve the triad of cognition, depression, and anxiety associated with AD. This circumstance prompts us to investigate the underlying mechanism and identify novel targets capable of mitigating cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, thereby preventing the progression of AD. The hallmarks of AD are the progressive extracellular accumulation of the protein amyloid beta plaques (Aβ) and phosphorylation of tau that results in intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formation. Aside from Aβ and NFTs affecting neurons, the development of AD pathology includes astrogliosis and microglial activation, and the loss of neurons and synaptic components , all of which contribute to cortical atrophy. These findings are consistent with the pathological changes shared by AD patients. Notably, Aβ insults and Tau phosphorylation activate inflammatory responses by stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokine release, inhibiting secondary messenger-related signaling within the central nervous and peripheral systems (CNS and PNS), and ultimately resulting in AD and related dementia consequences . Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in developing and exacerbating AD/ADRD by downregulating second messenger levels, i.e., cAMP and cGMP in neurons and glial cells . Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have received widespread attention as potential targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric indications. PDE is a large family and is divided into 11 family members, which control cAMP and cGMP levels in cells by degrading cAMP and/or cGMP, thus regulating the process of cell signal transduction. The inhibition of PDEs in the brain has emerged as an innovative strategy for treating AD/ADRD and related psychiatric disorders due to their ability to hydrolyze intracellular cGMP and/or cAMP. Among PDE families, phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) has been proven to be a competitive target of new drug development for AD/ADRD and MDD by regulating neuroinflammatory response . This review summarizes the current research progress on the role of PDE4 and its subtypes in regulating cAMP signaling pathways and the inflammatory response in mediating symptoms of AD/ADRD and MDD, with a focus on investigating the crucial role of PDE4 in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric indications.",
        "conclusion": "AD and related depression and anxiety represent significant neuropsychiatric conditions that collectively affect millions of people worldwide. According to the current research, neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in both disorders’ development and exacerbation, and PDE4 is a promising pharmacological target for its diverse roles in the physiological and behavioral modulation of the CNS. The pharmacological inhibition of PDE4 has been confirmed to elevate cAMP levels and the related signal transduction pathways, attenuating inflammatory responses and enhancing neuroprotection. With a further understanding of the action of PDE4 and its isoforms in the CNS and advances in drug development technology, we are expected to develop more selective and effective PDE4 isoform-specific inhibitors for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with AD."

        "title": "Investigation of Potential Drug Targets Involved in Inflammation Contributing to Alzheimer's Disease Progression.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease has become a major public health issue. While extensive research has been conducted in the last few decades, few drugs have been approved by the FDA to treat Alzheimer's disease. There is still an urgent need for understanding the disease pathogenesis, as well as identifying new drug targets for further drug discovery. Alzheimer's disease is known to arise from a build-up of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques as well as tangles of tau proteins. Along similar lines to Alzheimer's disease, inflammation in the brain is known to stem from the degeneration of tissue and build-up of insoluble materials. A minireview was conducted in this work assessing the genes, proteins, reactions, and pathways that link brain inflammation and Alzheimer's disease. Existing tools in Systems Biology were implemented to build protein interaction networks, mainly for the classical complement pathway and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), to rank the protein targets according to their interactions. The top 10 protein targets were mainly from the classical complement pathway. With the consideration of existing clinical trials and crystal structures, proteins C5AR1 and GARBG1 were identified as the best targets for further drug discovery, through computational approaches like ligand-protein docking techniques.",
        "year": "2024",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38276010/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease associated with damaged neurons in the brain that cause progressive memory loss and impaired functions. There are more than 35 million people worldwide who are impacted by this disease, and cases are arising with an increasing trend , with more than 100 million predicted to suffer from the disease by 2040–2050 . Thus, this disease is becoming an increasing concern as it continues to negatively impact not only the patients themselves, but also their families and the healthcare system as a whole . Scans, such as Positron Emission Tomography, to check for selected biomarkers (e.g., amyloid beta plaques, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration) cost around USD 3000 per test and expose patients to high levels of radiation, while cerebrospinal fluid tests are invasive with significant risk . Due to the degenerative nature of the disease, care requirements and costs only increase with time, placing higher demands on the patients and those caring for them. The degeneration begins slowly when the patient has a mild form of the disease, but it accelerates as the disease progresses. However, the change in progression is often abrupt, increasing the difficulty of providing patient care . Initial stages of the disease can begin with a long stretch of being asymptomatic. Diagnostic tools for this period could assist in detecting the presence of the disease before symptoms manifest, but there have not yet been any specific biomarkers established as identifying factors for the disease . Alzheimer’s disease is linked to an accumulation of insoluble amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and tangles of tau proteins . The level of Aβ plaque buildup has been hypothesized to directly correlate with the progression of Alzheimer’s symptoms, eventually resulting in brain atrophy and death . Therefore, these two abnormalities have become key targets in evaluating how the disease could be mitigated or treated. Despite decades of research and numerous attempts, very few drugs have been approved by the FDA to help treat Alzheimer’s disease or mitigate the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Three of the approved drugs, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that focus on promoting neurotransmission, slowing the progression of symptoms but not stopping the disease . A fourth drug, memantine, is a N-methyl D-aspartate receptor ion channel antagonist that is able to reduce tau levels through the activation of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A . Only two drugs have been approved that aim to stop disease progression rather than treat the symptoms. In June of 2021, the drug aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets Aβ plaques, was approved, although it has the undesirable effects of inducing vasogenic edema and cerebral microhemorrhage . Leqembi (also named as lecanemab-irmb), another monoclonal antibody targeting Aβ, was approved in January 2023 for patients in the early stages of dementia . Most other drugs targeting Aβ have not successfully progressed through clinical trials, primarily due to their lack of curative efficacy. An example of this was verubecestat, a BACE-1 inhibitor that did not help either moderate or early-stage patients . Other BACE-1 inhibitors, as well as PSEN-1 inhibitors, show severe side effects due to their suppression of additional enzymes that are essential for biological functionality . Moreover, there exists an additional challenge: any medication for treating Alzheimer’s disease needs to be able to cross the blood–brain barrier. Any targets chosen in the brain also need to be checked to see that they are not vital to other pathways or functions. An example of this would be GSK-3β inhibitors, as these targets are necessary for glucose metabolism and Wnt-β-catenin, a signaling pathway involved in tissue homeostasis . This means that there is a serious demand for drug treatment options that aim to be curative rather than just treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. In order to generate the best possible options, key targets for the drugs need to be identified. A starting point may involve looking at what the disease shares comorbidities with, such as inflammation in the brain. Along similar lines to Alzheimer’s disease, inflammation in the brain is caused by a combination of degenerating tissue and a buildup of abnormal insoluble materials . Thus, there is a clear potential link between the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease and inflammation in the brain, especially as the disease progresses to later stages, where neuronal death and degeneration levels are higher. As the Aβ plaques and tau tangles begin forming at the early onset of Alzheimer’s disease, their presence only increases as the disease continues. Therefore, the cytokines that mediate inflammation in the regions where Alzheimer’s disease has affected the brain are chronically upregulated . While it was originally thought that inflammation occurred alongside Alzheimer’s disease due to the dead tissue caused by excess Aβ and tau, the constant presence of inflammation is now hypothesized to increase the neurodegenerative progression of Alzheimer’s disease and attack living neural tissues . The linkage of inflammation to cytokine production leads to behavioral changes known as sickness behavior, involving reduced activity, appetite, and social interaction, as well as fever . These cytokines may also exacerbate neuronal loss due to Aβ plaques and the accumulation of tau protein . Originally, it was thought that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) would prevail in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, or at least slow the progression, but there have been no positive trial results so far . This may stem from the fact that the mechanisms involved in reducing inflammation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease are currently unclear . However, additional NSAID-derived options are also being explored. CereSpir is investigating a small molecule called CSP-1103 that is made via an NSAID scaffold that has reduced COX-1 inhibition and removed COX-2 inhibition, allowing it to increase microglial phagocytic activity and decrease tissue-damaging cytokines . Retinoid X receptors, such as bexarotene (i.e., Targretin), have similarly been investigated, as retinoids play a role in immune responses, including the production of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), induction of microglial phagocytosis, and reductions in Aβ levels . The TNF-α blocker etanercept is being evaluated for its role in both microglial priming and system inflammation . Additionally, BACE-1 and γ-secretase were seen as potential drug targets, although no treatments have been approved for them. One potential reason is that both have been demonstrated to be essential for functions in the body beyond Alzheimer’s disease . Due to the potential impact of Alzheimer’s-related inflammation, understanding which pathways and proteins are relevant to both Alzheimer’s disease and inflammation could help identify which genes and proteins may be potential drug targets for inhibition treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. These targets offer greater potential for the development of curative drugs, as opposed to those primarily focused on symptom management. This paper firstly provides an overview of the key pathways and mechanisms of inflammation related to Alzheimer’s disease reported in the literature. Based on this review, essential genes and proteins were then identified within the explored pathways. However, not all of these genes would prove to be drug targets for treatments. Therefore, the genes and proteins linked to both Alzheimer’s disease and inflammation were extracted from the DisGeNet database. Subsequently, they underwent evaluation for their relevance to each condition through protein interaction network analysis. The ideal potential targets between both groups were then further explored to investigate their druggability (via an evaluation of existing crystal structures and clinical trials), and their possible relevance to pathways essential to functions beyond Alzheimer’s disease.",
        "conclusion": "In order to evaluate the numerous proteins mentioned in the above sections, their connections and roles in the body have to be analyzed. This work does not aim to develop new programs for drug target identification. Instead, existing tools in Systems Biology were integrated to evaluate the gene targets mentioned in the previous sections. In particular, a program named STRING, a commonly used tool in systems biology to establish the connections of each gene based on database information , was implemented to build a protein interaction network for genes from the classical complement pathway (Section 3.1) and GPCR genes (Section 3.2). The protein interaction networks were then imported into programs named Cytoscape and MCODE for better visualization of their highly interacting networks. The proteins were further ranked using Cytohubba on the basis of their interactions, with darker red indicating the highest-ranking proteins and lighter yellow indicating low-scoring proteins. The protein interaction networks were thus built for those involved directly with the classical complement pathway (Figure 3) and GPCRs (Figure 4). The functions of the proteins shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. The ranking of the classical complement pathway components shows that the majority of the high-scoring genes are those in the main part of the pathway. This matches predictions, as these components are involved in starting the cascades that stem from the main pathway. These include C1R, C1s, C2, C3, and C4a/b. The lower-ranked genes seem to be binding proteins that are involved near the ends of the pathway, such as C4BPA and CR1. However, the GPCRs in Figure 4 are clustered into two distinct groups, with one group being significantly more connected than the other. This may be influenced by the fact that many of these GPCRs were identified as being independently involved with Alzheimer’s inflammation. It is important to note that the GPCRs in the right cluster relate to APP and BACE1, which, while not ideal targets themselves, are well-known in their involvement with Alzheimer’s disease. However, the RABs do not currently have full crystal structures available, which would make it hard to identify small molecule inhibitors for RABs. Additionally, they are GTPases, which exist in high quantities in the body, so targeting them could potentially be toxic or have too much of a negative impact on biological function. The results of both the literature review and the protein interaction analysis identified numerous genes that play key roles in the systemic inflammation that arises from and exacerbates Alzheimer’s disease. However, not all of these genes would serve well as a drug target. Therefore, each gene must be considered in a larger context of the body. Some genes play too-important roles in other key bodily functions to be inhibited without serious consequences or side effects. Other targets may be acceptable in terms of function but would be difficult to target with drug therapeutics due to their location or size. Additionally, in order to be evaluated, the crystal structure of the gene must be available. To begin this evaluation, all of the proteins (encoded by genes) used in the previous evaluations (i.e., Figure 3 and Figure 4) were further evaluated together to establish the top ten total potential protein targets, depicted below in Figure 5. The crystal structures, along with clinical trials, are listed in Table 3 for these top ten potential protein targets. For the classical complement pathway, ideal targets would come from those that are more specific to inflammation to avoid potential side effects. Targets should not be located too early in the pathway either, as that would halt the cascade too early or in a way that negatively impacts the ability of the body to function. Many of the early components are needed to form later complexes, which in turn may play additional roles in the brain. This would also mean that a receptor would likely prove a better target than one of the mobile components. This idea also contributes to why GPCRs make ideal targets. GPCRs have already been proven to serve as drug targets for 50–60% of current drugs and work well with small molecule inhibitors . However, while essential to inflammation in the brain, any cytokine discussed would not make for an ideal target, as they tend to be involved in multiple functions outside of inflammation and would also be hard to target with drug molecules. For example, IL-6 is a cytokine that may directly contribute to the negative impact of inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease. However, it is also considered a multifunctional cytokine and is responsible for multiple biological activities, including differentiating B-cells into immunoglobulin-producing cells, fever responses, neutrophil tracking, and other immune responses . It also follows the kynurenine pathway. Exploring the linkage between these two pathways would help increase understanding of how inflammation works in the brain, but it would not be ideal to target this pathway directly. Although it could be investigated further due to its extreme relevance to Alzheimer’s patients, the kynurenine pathway is most relevant to depression and is not an inflammation pathway. Additionally, the ideal target must be able to interact with a potential therapy drug, which means size and accessibility must be considered, especially due to the added issue of crossing the blood–brain barrier. As previously mentioned, the targets from the classical component pathway would not be ideal. This would eliminate C1R/S, C4a/b, C3, and C2. SERPING1 (a C1 inhibitor) is synthesized in the liver and is significantly involved in blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and the generation of kinins . Ultimately, this would decrease its viability as a target. Additionally, the need for a crystal structure would eliminate C3AR1 and C1QB. This leaves C5AR1 as the ideal target, which will be evaluated in future work. This aligns with predictions as it is a GPCR connected to the classical complement pathway, specifically with C5a, which is an anaphylatoxin with pro-inflammatory functions. Additionally, while not entirely unstudied, not much research has been conducted evaluating antagonists that target C5AR1 while considering Alzheimer’s disease. Previous research has included peptide antagonists, which reached Phase 2 clinical trials in the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis . However, problems arose regarding off-target activity, production costs, immunogenicity, and oral bioavailability. In 2021, for the treatment of severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis, the FDA approved avacopen (Tavneo, ChemoCentryx, South San Francisco, CA, USA), a C5a receptor . Avacopen was also evaluated for patients with IgAN. Other options for targeting C5AR1 include small-molecule competitive antagonists W54011 and NDT95137327 . Referring back to the top GPCRs in Figure 4, additional possible targets that have been less studied in their application for Alzheimer’s include GARBG1, which is related to the main inhibitory neurotransmitter for the CNS, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) . Decreased receptor levels of the A-subgroup of GABAs have been shown to have a direct relationship with CNS disorders . This likely stems from the fact that GABA plays a role in stabilizing neuronal activity and initiating other essential related processes, including the formation of protective barriers (including the blood–brain barrier) . The crystal structure for the predominant isoform of GABA-A receptors has also been used for numerous studies, including those that focused on the mechanisms of possible drug interactions and signaling . Another top-scoring gene was ARF6, a small G protein . ARF6 has been linked to neurodegeneration through cholesterol . However, its size may prove an issue in binding with other molecules. The other GPCRs listed from the Rab family are GTPases, which exist in large quantities in the body, therefore making them a non-ideal target in terms of toxicity."

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia and is defined as a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which predominantly manifests as an impairment of cognitive function, particularly anterograde episodic memory, accompanied by declines in visuospatial, language, and executive functions (1). Data from the World Alzheimer’s Disease Report 2023 suggests that the number of people with dementia worldwide will increase from 55 million in 2019 to 139 million in 2050 (2). Moreover, with rapidly aging populations throughout, the number of dementia patients will further increase. As the leading cause of dementia (accounting for 60–80% of all cases), AD prevalence is also on the rise, posing an ever greater socioeconomic and healthcare burden. Genetic predisposition has been established as a major risk factor for AD. Mutations in several genes, including amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and the ϵ4 allele of apolipoprotein E, have been implicated in AD pathogenesis (3). Further, a number of immune-related genes have been identified as strongly associated with AD (4). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also gained ground with increasing sample sizes and inexpensive gene chip technology, which has expanded our understanding of the genetic architecture of AD (5). Integration of AD GWAS with tissue- and cell-type-specific epigenetic annotations has suggested a modulatory role for various immune components in AD susceptibility. In addition to microglia, which have been at the center of AD research, the adaptive immune cells T and B lymphocytes have been shown to play a key role in regulating AD pathology (6–8), which influences AD progression and disease severity. Therefore, understanding the intricate relationship between immunity and AD would be a promising strategic direction that could contribute to a deeper insight into the pathogenesis of AD and facilitate the discovery of novel immune-related biodiagnostic markers. Targeted modulation of the activities of different immune components will also facilitate the development of new therapeutic interventions. The involvement of different cellular and molecular subtypes, pathways and networks in the pathogenesis of AD has limited the understanding of the heterogeneity and complexity of AD and has significantly hindered progress in the diagnosis and treatment of AD. In recent years, with the increasing development of multi-omics such as genetics and genome projects, data mining research has shown its importance in AD research. Bioinformatics analysis is a discipline based on the combination of computer science and bioinformatics tools, methods and techniques (9), where collected DNA, mRNA and protein data can be analyzed and organized as required. It can reveal potential modes of action and disease mechanisms at the molecular level, depending on the research objectives. However, effective integration of multi-omics data is particularly important due to small sample sizes and redundant data. Machine learning (ML) combined with bioinformatics data can overcome the limitations of data set size and build predictive models for disease occurrence and progression by effectively mining large amounts of data (10, 11). Based on the manipulation of multi-omics data, ML uses different algorithms to extract unique insights from the data to target different immune cells and immune-related genes, and successfully achieves the precise analysis of the key functions of immune-related signature genes in the pathogenesis of AD. This study delves into the expression of novel immune-related genes in AD, shedding light on their pivotal roles in immune processes and pathways. By analyzing immune cell infiltration and clinical correlations, the research uncovers valuable insights into AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, the development of a diagnostic nomogram based on these genes offers a promising tool for AD diagnosis. The study also explores potential treatments by identifying small molecule compounds through advanced technology. These findings not only deepen our understanding of AD but also provide new avenues for targeted interventions and future clinical trials in the quest for effective AD therapies.",
        "conclusion": "AD, a chronic neurodegenerative disease and the top cause of dementia, is influenced by a range of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors (35). Despite extensive research, a comprehensive understanding of AD’s pathogenesis is still lacking, and no effective treatment has been developed thus far. Given the significant variation in pathogenesis among AD patients, further investigation is necessary to explore biodiagnostic markers. ML offers a unique approach to efficiently process multidimensional data, integrate data from various sources, and discover novel biomarkers. The application of ML in disease management and the development of therapeutic options has proven invaluable (36). In our study, we aimed to further explore the genomic characteristics of AD by utilizing the WGCNA algorithm to construct co-expression networks. Our analysis revealed the blue module as a significant gene module positively associated with AD. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the feature genes within the blue module were predominantly enriched in immune response-related functions and pathways. By employing a cut-off criteria of GS > 0.70 and MM > 0.92, we identified two feature genes, namely RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B, that were associated with AD. Among the immune-related genes linked to AD, RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B show promising diagnostic potential (4). Our comparative analysis of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B expression in various neurodegenerative diseases has revealed that their heightened expression is distinctive to AD, contrasting conditions like PD, FTD, DLB, and HD. This observation underscores the diagnostic value of these markers in AD and their potential for clinical application. Although current research primarily relies on post-mortem brain tissue, the absence of evidence for detecting RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B in body fluids such as peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid does not rule out potential future advancements. As technology progresses and research intensifies, novel methods for detecting these molecules in body fluids may emerge. More sensitive assays or advanced biomarker detection technologies, including single-molecule sequencing, could facilitate their detection in body fluid samples. Additionally, our finding that RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B are significantly expressed in multiple brain regions - including the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and visual cortex - provides flexibility in selecting a safe and accessible site for brain biopsy sampling. As minimally invasive techniques improve, physicians may conduct more precise and safer brain surgeries for tissue sampling, further advancing our knowledge and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Considering the age-related nature of AD and the observed gender disparities in its incidence, prevalence, and biomarker profiles (37), we analyzed the expression patterns of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B concerning age and gender. Our findings demonstrated a consistent increase in the expression of both genes among individuals aged 65 years and older, particularly those with AD. Notably, the expression levels were significantly higher in AD patients than in controls, irrespective of age. Furthermore, we observed higher expression levels in females compared to males, a trend also evident among AD patients. These results suggest that RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and are influenced by both age and gender. To further explore the potential of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B as biomarkers, we integrated these genes with variables such as age and gender, employing a multivariate logistic regression model to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between the control group and AD patients. The model exhibited impressive results, demonstrating outstanding performance in both the training set and internal validation set, with AUC values exceeding 0.9, indicating strong diagnostic accuracy. To further validate the diagnostic utility of these genes, we meticulously developed diagnostic nomograms and assessed the model’s predictive capacity from various perspectives using CCA, DCA, and CIC analyses. The findings from these extensive validations confirm the reliability and precision of the model, highlighting the potential of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B as robust biomarkers for AD. Through comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, we observed significant upregulation of RHBDF2 in the AD patient group. RHBDF2, also known as iRhom2, belongs to the rhomboid family, which is an evolutionarily conserved family of intramembrane serine proteases (38, 39). Although structurally similar to rhomboid, RHBDF2 lacks the essential catalytic residues, earning it the classification of a pseudoprotease (38). Mammals possess two forms of iRhom, RHBDF1 (also known as iRhom1) and RHBDF2. RHBDF2 acts as a cargo receptor for a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), facilitating its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Within the Golgi apparatus, ADAM17 matures through furin-mediated cleavage, which removes its inhibitory structural domain. Ultimately, RHBDF2 aids in ADAM17 translocation to the plasma membrane, facilitating the shedding of TNF and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands (38, 40, 41). Previous studies have highlighted the diverse functions of RHBDF2 in immune-mediated diseases, specifically its regulation of pathways such as TNF, EGFR, and stimulator of interferon genes signaling (41). Our GeneMANIA analysis further supported the involvement of RHBDF2 in the EGFR and ERBB signaling pathways, where it interacts with RHBDF1, ADAM17, and EGF within the GeneMANIA network. Immune dysregulation is recognized as a significant contributor to AD pathogenesis. Epigenome-wide association studies focused on AD have identified an association between DNA methylation at RHBDF2 loci and AD risk (42–45). However, the precise mechanism by which RHBDF2 contributes to AD remains unclear. Notably, RHBDF2 operates within the same protein interaction network as PTK2B (43), a known AD risk gene that plays a crucial role in the signaling cascade governing microglia and infiltrating macrophage activation (46). Furthermore, RHBDF2 exhibits expression in a specific subset of immune cells, including microglia. This suggests that RHDBF2 might aggravate AD pathology through microglia-driven inflammatory responses (38, 47, 48). In line with this, Bennett et al. reported an increase in RHBDF2 expression in the context of AD (42). Consistently, our study’s violin diagram displayed significantly elevated gene expression levels of RHBDF2 in the AD group compared to the control group. Therefore, targeting RHBDF2 holds potential for exploring novel therapeutic interventions for AD. We also discovered TNFSR10B as another risk gene showing upregulation in the AD group. TNFSR10B, also known as death receptor 5 (DR5) or TRAIL-R2, acts as a receptor for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is also referred to as Apo-2 ligand (Apo2L), and TNFSF10 (49, 50). The initial report by Rauch et al. (51). in 1997 introduced TRAIL as a potent pro-apoptotic cytokine that induces apoptosis during peripheral and central inflammation through complex interactions between ligands and receptors (49, 50, 52). The TNF superfamily includes five distinct TRAIL receptors: DR4 (TRAIL-R1, TNFRSF10A), DR5 (TNFRSF10B), DcR1 (TRAIL-R3, TNFRSF10C), DcR2 (TRAIL-R4, TNFRSF10D), and osteoprotegerin (49, 52). Notably, DR4 and DR5 activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway through their intracellular death domains, while DcR1 and DcR2 function as decoy receptors (49, 50, 52). Consistent with these findings, our GeneMANIA analysis indicated that TNFRSF10B is primarily involved in the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, interacting with TNFSF10, FAS, FADD, and CASP8 to form the death-inducing signaling complex. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have reported the involvement of TNFSF10/TNFRSF10B in amyloid β peptide (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity (50, 53–55). Immunoneutralization of TNFSF10 or blockade of TNFRSF10B has been shown to prevent Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity and suppress the immune/inflammatory response, as confirmed in both in vivo and in vitro experiments (50, 53–55). Thus, the interaction between TNFSF10 and TNFRSF10B holds promise as a potential therapeutic target for AD. While previous research has suggested the pathological roles of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B in the progression of AD, there has been a lack of in-depth exploration into their specific connections with immune cells or immune responses. Particularly regarding the role of RHBDF2 in AD, current studies are relatively limited. Existing clues suggest that RHBDF2 may exacerbate the pathology of AD through inflammation driven by microglia, as indicated by its extension through the same protein interaction network as PTK2B. Our research further confirms the detrimental impacts of elevated levels of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B in the development of AD, linking them to immune cells, especially microglia, providing a new research direction for these factors in exacerbating AD pathology through mediating immune dysregulation. Notably, our study also reveals a close association of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B with immune cell infiltration in AD progression. Within AD patients, levels of monocytes, neutrophils, M1 macrophages are significantly increased, while levels of plasma cells and CD8+ T cells are decreased. Correlation analyses indicate that the expression levels of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B are positively correlated with monocytes, neutrophils, and M1 macrophages, and negatively correlated with CD8+ T cells and plasma cells. Overall, these findings suggest that the dysregulation or dysfunction of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B may be pathogenic factors in AD, likely exacerbating the pathological process of AD through immune and inflammatory reactions mediated by microglia or peripheral infiltrating immune cells. Our study paves the way for unravelling the molecular mechanisms of immune dysregulation in AD. Ultimately, our aim is to develop personalized neuroimmune therapeutic strategies that actively impact the treatment outcomes of AD by targeting the interactions between RHBDF2, TNFRSF10B, and immune cells. To align with the development of novel therapeutic approaches, we screened 17 specific genes, including RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B, in the CMap database to identify potential AD therapeutic drugs. Notably, we identified dinaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, and tanespimycin, a heat shock protein (HSP) inhibitor, as potential candidate drugs for treating AD targeting RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B. In addition, molecular docking results showed that dinaciclib and tanespimycin had better binding activity with RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B. CDKs are key regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle and are involved in essential biological processes such as transcription, metabolism, communication, and apoptosis (56). Recent studies have reported the association between cell cycle dysregulation and key pathological features of AD, including the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposits and hyperphosphorylated tau (57). It has been proposed that cell cycle re-entry contributes to neuronal death in AD (58), thereby suggesting CDKs as potential therapeutic targets (57). The potential use of dinaciclib, a multi-CDK inhibitor targeting CDK1, 2, 5, and 9, in the treatment of AD is yet to be evaluated. HSPs, a family of highly conserved molecular chaperones, play a crucial role in maintaining intracellular protein homeostasis. They accomplish this by ensuring proper folding, assisting in the refolding of denatured proteins, and promoting the degradation of damaged proteins (59). Among the HSPs, HSP90 stands out as the most abundant molecular chaperone in cells. It is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including diverse signaling and regulatory pathways (60). As a result, HSP90 has become an attractive target for drug development. One of the key functions of HSP90 is its strict regulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) activation. Normally, HSF-1 binds to HSP90 under normal conditions. However, when cells are subjected to stress, HSF-1 dissociates from HSP90. Once released, phosphorylated HSF-1 translocates to the nucleus where it regulates the transcriptional activation of various heat shock proteins, including HSP27, HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90 (61). Geldanamycin, an inhibitor of HSP90, facilitates the dissociation of the HSF-1-HSP90 complex, leading to the activation of the heat shock response. This activation is achieved through the upregulation of HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90 (62). Tanespimycin, also known as 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, is a semi-synthetic derivative of geldanamycin that has attracted considerable attention for the treatment of various diseases, including AD. Tanespimycin possesses superior pharmacokinetics and is associated with lower toxicity. Animal studies investigating the effectiveness of tanespimycin in AD models have yielded positive results, further supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent (63–65). In summary, the objective of this study was to delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD through bioinformatics and ML analysis. Our findings indicate that RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B could play a crucial role in AD pathogenesis by disrupting the immune homeostasis of the intracerebral microenvironment via central immune cells or immune cells infiltrating from peripheral sources. These genes offer promising avenues for therapeutic research in AD and could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers. However, it is imperative to acknowledge the limitations of our study. Firstly, detection of RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B expression levels in peripheral blood samples, as well as confirmation in cellular or animal models, has not yet been achieved. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of small molecule drugs on AD have not been validated through cellular experiments. In future research, we aim to thoroughly investigate the mRNA and protein levels of these feature genes using techniques such as qPCR and western blotting. By employing gene interference methods like siRNA, we intend to elucidate the precise mechanisms of these genes in AD pathogenesis. Additionally, visualizing the binding of small molecule drugs to the target genes and their therapeutic impact on AD will necessitate conducting relevant cellular experiments to enhance the depth and comprehensiveness of our research findings. Secondly, there exist challenges in comprehending immune cell infiltration in AD brain tissue and its association with these feature genes. Future studies could validate our experimental results by performing scRNAseq/snRNAseq on physical samples. Lastly, the absence of mild cognitive impairment samples hinders the determination of whether these genes can be utilized as early diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Consequently, further basic and clinical research is imperative to validate our current understanding of the relationship between these genes and the immune system in the context of AD pathophysiology. Our analysis comprehensively elucidates the intricate connection between immune dysregulation and the pathogenesis of AD. Notably, our study identifies two pivotal diagnostic effector genes, RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B, which are intricately linked to diverse immune responses and distinct immune cell populations. Furthermore, we have successfully constructed a diagnostic model for enhanced AD diagnosis based on RHBDF2 and TNFRSF10B. Ultimately, the identification of these diagnostic genes is anticipated to propel the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies and pave the way for targeted AD therapy, forging new frontiers in the field."

        "title": "Genome-Wide Mendelian Randomization Identifies Ferroptosis-Related Drug Targets for Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently lacks effective disease-modifying treatments. Recent research suggests that ferroptosis could be a potential therapeutic target. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a widely used method for identifying novel therapeutic targets. OBJECTIVE: Employ genetic information to evaluate the causal impact of ferroptosis-related genes on the risk of AD. METHODS: 564 ferroptosis-related genes were obtained from FerrDb. We derived genetic instrumental variables for these genes using four brain quantitative trait loci (QTL) and two blood QTL datasets. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and two-sample MR methods were applied to estimate the causal effects of ferroptosis-related genes on AD. Using extern transcriptomic datasets and triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) to further validate the gene targets identified by the MR analysis. RESULTS: We identified 17 potential AD risk gene targets from GTEx, 13 from PsychENCODE, and 22 from BrainMeta (SMR p < 0.05 and HEIDI test p > 0.05). Six overlapping ferroptosis-related genes associated with AD were identified, which could serve as potential therapeutic targets (PEX10, CDC25A, EGFR, DLD, LIG3, and TRIB3). Additionally, we further pinpointed risk genes or proteins at the blood tissue and pQTL levels. Notably, EGFR demonstrated significant dysregulation in the extern transcriptomic datasets and 3xTg-AD models. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides genetic evidence supporting the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting the six druggable genes for AD treatment, especially for EGFR (validated by transcriptome and 3xTg-AD), which could be useful for prioritizing AD drug development in the field of ferroptosis.",

        "introduction": "Over the past three decades, there has been a noticeable increase in the global prevalence and societal and economic impact of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), underscoring the imperative for extensive research into its pathogenesis and potential treatments.1 The pathogenesis of AD is complex, involving multiple factors such as amyloid-β (Aβ) toxicity, tau protein, genetic mutations, synaptic damage, and neuroinflammation.2,3 Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, has offered fresh insights into comprehending the pathogenesis of AD.4 Recent studies suggest that ferroptosis might be involved in the pathological process of AD.5,6 There are several similarities between the characteristics of AD pathogenesis and those of ferroptosis, such as iron accumulation and lipid peroxides.7,8 As a result, ferroptosis is gradually being acknowledged as a unique cell death mechanism that contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Interestingly, we also observed a close correlation between neuronal death and ferroptosis in AD patients. Elevated levels of iron and markers of lipid peroxidation have been detected in the brains of AD patients.4 Dysregulation of iron metabolism, specifically the accumulation of iron within neurons, has been implicated in the initiation of ferroptosis. This aberrant iron accumulation leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which in turn triggers lipid peroxidation and the subsequent death of neurons through ferroptosis.4,9 Substantial efforts have been invested in the search for treatments that can modify AD, but significant progress remains elusive due to the unknown pathophysiology of the disease.10 Given the presence of iron deposits in the brains of AD patients, ferroptosis inhibitors offer promising prospects for AD treatment.11 Excess iron can worsen oxidative damage, and targeting ferroptosis may help alleviate cognitive deficits and oxidative stress in AD.12,13 However, the research on ferroptosis inhibitors and AD is still in its early stages. Large-scale human genetic studies provide a unique avenue for innovative drug development for complex diseases. This is because drug targets backed by genetic evidence have a higher likelihood of success in drug discovery pipelines.14 MR analysis has been widely utilized to adapt licensed drugs and uncover novel therapeutic targets by amalgamating summary data from disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies.15 The levels of gene expression can be viewed as a form of long-term exposure, and QTLs situated in the genomic region of “druggable” genes are always regarded as proxies.16 Additionally, previous studies have used MR methods to assess the causal effects of disease exposure or biomarkers on various neurodegenerative diseases, further validating the reliability of our research approach and enriching our background knowledge for this study.17–19 This MR study employing brain-specific and blood-specific expression QTLs (eQTLs) and protein QTLs (pQTLs) of ferroptosis-related genes as instrumental variables, with ferroptosis-related genes as the exposure factor and AD GWAS summary-level data as the outcome factor, enables us to identify potential drug targets associated with ferroptosis in AD. This strategy employs genetic information to evaluate the causal impact of ferroptosis-related genes on the risk of AD and can offer valuable insights for the development of targeted therapies for AD.",
        "conclusion": "Using the MR method, we have identified six ferroptosis-related gene targets associated with AD. Notably, EGFR showed significant dysregulation in external transcriptomic datasets and 3xTg-AD models, suggesting its potential role in regulating ferroptosis in AD. These findings suggest EGFR could serve as a promising target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating ferroptosis in AD treatment strategies."

        "title": "Investigation of Potential Drug Targets for Cholesterol Regulation to Treat Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "abstract": "Despite extensive research and seven approved drugs, the complex interplay of genes, proteins, and pathways in Alzheimer's disease remains a challenge. This implies the intricacies of the mechanism for Alzheimer's disease, which involves the interaction of hundreds of genes, proteins, and pathways. While the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, excessive accumulation of cholesterol is reportedly correlated with Alzheimer's disease patients. In this work, protein-protein interaction analysis was conducted based upon the genes from a clinical database to identify the top protein targets with most data-indicated involvement in Alzheimer's disease, which include ABCA1, CYP46A1, BACE1, TREM2, GSK3B, and SREBP2. The reactions and pathways associated with these genes were thoroughly studied for their roles in regulating brain cholesterol biosynthesis, amyloid beta accumulation, and tau protein tangle formation. Existing clinical trials for each protein target were also investigated. The research indicated that the inhibition of SREBP2, BACE1, or GSK3B is beneficial to reduce cholesterol and amyloid beta accumulation, while the activation of ABCA1, CYP46A1, or TREM2 has similar effects. In this study, Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 2 (SREBP2) emerged as the primary protein target. SREBP2 serves a pivotal role in maintaining cholesterol balance, acting as a transcription factor that controls the expression of several enzymes pivotal for cholesterol biosynthesis. Novel studies suggest that SREBP2 performs a multifaceted role in Alzheimer's disease. The hyperactivity of SREBP2 may lead to heightened cholesterol biosynthesis, which suggested association with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Lowering SREBP2 levels in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model results in reduced production of amyloid-beta, a major contributor to Alzheimer's disease progression. Moreover, its thoroughly analyzed crystal structure allows for computer-aided screening of potential inhibitors; SREBP2 is thus selected as a prospective drug target. While more protein targets can be added onto the list in the future, this work provides an overview of key proteins involved in the regulation of brain cholesterol biosynthesis that may be further investigated for Alzheimer's disease intervention.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles, which lead to neuronal and synaptic loss . It is the most common cause of dementia and is difficult to diagnose due to the fact that many of the symptoms are similar to the normal effects of aging . Research on Alzheimer’s disease has increased over the years since this disease worsens over time and has no cure . Excessive cholesterol has been found to accumulate in the brain of those with Alzheimer’s disease, specifically in the myelin, astrocytes, and neurons . Cholesterol can be synthesized in both the blood and the brain, but the majority of biosynthesis in the adult brain takes place in astrocytes and is then transported to the neurons via ApoE . The blood brain barrier separates cholesterol metabolism in the brain from the rest of the body . Brain cholesterol synthesis is similar to that of blood cholesterol synthesis, starting with de novo synthesis in which acetyl-CoA is converted into HMG-CoA . The rate-limiting enzyme HMGCR catalyzes the reduction of HMG-CoA into mevalonate . A few more reactions take place, leading to the production of zymosterol, which proceeds either through the Bloch pathway or Kandustch-Russel pathway; both pathways result in the production of cholesterol. Various proteins contribute to the metabolism of cholesterol in the brain, which offer potential targets for Alzheimer’s treatment. In the astrocytes, SCAP binds to SREBP2 in order to transport the complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus . Cholesterol is secreted out of the astrocytes by the ABCA1 transporter . Lipoprotein receptors such as TREM2 internalize cholesterol into the microglia, while lipoprotein receptors such as LRP1 internalize cholesterol into the neuron . The gene CYP46A1 converts excess cholesterol to 24S-OHC . While cholesterol in the blood is dependent on the balance between dietary and hepatic synthesis, cholesterol in the brain is mainly synthesized in situ by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. As a person ages, his/her brain cholesterol synthesis rate declines and the blood brain barrier loses its integrity . Studies have also found that cholesterol has a direct effect on the production of amyloid-beta and tau proteins . The addition of cholesterol to the brain promotes the activity of BACE1, secretase, and APP, which all aid in amyloid-beta production. The reduction of cholesterol esters in the brain has been found to reduce phosphorylated tau levels in mice. Many drugs have been developed to combat Alzheimer’s disease, but these drugs slow the progression of neurological symptoms rather than modifying the disease itself . For example, Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine, Memantine, and Suvorexant are all FDA approved drugs that treat the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease without changing the progression of the disease . On the other hand, many drugs that were in clinical trials have been terminated due to their lack of improvement in cognitive function, despite their abilities to decrease amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau accumulation . Monoclonal antibodies have been developed to help the body clear amyloid-beta plaques from the brain. In 2021, the FDA approved Aduhelm for the treatment of those with early Alzheimer’s disease. This drug was effective at removing amyloid-beta plaques but was ineffective at slowing cognitive decline . Lecanemab is the second monoclonal antibody approved by FDA to treat Alzheimer’s disease . Concerns on side effects were raised for this drug. The only other FDA approved drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease are Aricept, Leqemni, Namenda, Namzaric, Reminyl, and Exelon Patch. Various other monoclonal antibody drugs, as well as tau aggregation inhibitors, are currently in clinical trials. A number of drugs have been developed in order to inhibit target genes that play critical roles in Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Two potential target genes, GSK3B and BACE1, have been deemed possible candidates as disease-modifying agents for Alzheimer’s disease due to their involvement in amyloid-beta and tau production, as well as their ability to enhance cognitive functions . In addition to these two genes, the proteins SREBP2, TREM2, LRP1, and the CYP46A1 gene are all additional candidates as targets to combat Alzheimer’s disease due to their involvement in the metabolic pathway of cholesterol in the brain . The limited number of FDA-approved drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease indicate the urgent need to accelerate the drug discovery pace. Since extensive evidence demonstrates the strong correlation between brain cholesterol regulation and Alzheimer’s disease , a detailed literature review on genes or pathways related to the brain cholesterol synthesis and regulation was conducted in this work. An interaction network was then built for those genes so that the top gene targets were identified. The involvement of these genes in Alzheimer’s disease progression was discussed in detail, which was followed by the investigation of existing clinical trials for those targets. The top drug targets were finally recommended with the consideration of existing crystal structures and the feasibility of computational screening for drug discovery. The results from this work pave the way for further drug discovery to regulate brain cholesterol to combat Alzheimer’s disease.",
        "conclusion": "High levels of cholesterol in the brain have been attributed to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease due to the connection between cholesterol synthesis and amyloid-beta plaques and tau-phosphorylation. Recently, studies have focused on targeting specific proteins involved in cholesterol synthesis/transport in order to treat Alzheimer’s disease. By utilizing existing clinical date from DisGeNET and undergoing protein-protein network analysis on cholesterol metabolism and Alzheimer’s disease, the top target genes selected were GSK3B, BACE1, SREBP2, CYP46A1, ABCA1, and TREM2. Each of these proteins were involved with cholesterol synthesis/transport, as well as the production of amyloid-beta and/or tau proteins. SREBP2, BACE1, and GSK3B were selected as the preferred target proteins for inhibition, while ABCA1, CYP46A1, and TREM2 are the protein targets for activation. The reactions and pathways for each of these targets in regulating brain cholesterol for Alzheimer’s disease progression were thoroughly investigated in this work. SREBP2 was recommended as a good target for future small molecule inhibitor screening due to its well-established crystal structure and its limited number of clinical trials. Molsoft ICM pro was recommended for virtual screening of chemical compounds with good binding affinities to the selected targets. The results from this work provide the Alzheimer’s research community with an overview of protein targets along with potential targets and approaches for further investigation."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents significant challenges in drug discovery and development due to its complex and poorly understood pathology and etiology. Digital twins (DTs) are recently developed virtual real-time representations of physical entities that enable rapid assessment of the bidirectional interaction between the virtual and physical domains. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing accumulation of multi-omics and clinical data, application of DTs in healthcare is gaining traction. Digital twin technology, in the form of multiscale virtual models of patients or organ systems, can track health status in real time with continuous feedback, thereby driving model updates that enhance clinical decision-making. Here, we posit an additional role for DTs in drug discovery, with particular utility for complex diseases like AD. In this review, we discuss salient challenges in AD drug development, including complex disease pathology and comorbidities, difficulty in early diagnosis, and the current high failure rate of clinical trials. We also review DTs and discuss potential applications for predicting AD progression, discovering biomarkers, identifying new drug targets and opportunities for drug repurposing, facilitating clinical trials, and advancing precision medicine. Despite significant hurdles in this area, such as integration and standardization of dynamic medical data and issues of data security and privacy, DTs represent a promising approach for revolutionizing drug discovery in AD.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and significant cause of worldwide dementia that is intrinsically linked to aging . As people are living longer, societies will be challenged by a corresponding rise in AD prevalence. It is currently estimated that in the United States alone around 6.7 million people over the age of 65 are living with AD, and that without discovery of effective treatments this number will rise to upwards of 14 million by 2050 . AD progression is characterized by depression, cognitive decline, memory loss, and ultimately the inability to execute basic life skills. It poses an enormous challenge and burden to individuals, families, and society . Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic interventions and preventive measures. AD has a complex pathophysiology characterized by accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, as well as general protein aggregation, epigenetic alterations, peripheral effects on the brain, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) deterioration, DNA damage, lipid dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, axonal degeneration, impaired postnatal neurogenesis, and synaptic dysfunction . Many of the therapeutic strategies currently being investigated are based on these mechanisms, although many have not yet been validated in clinical trials . Out of all Phase III clinical trials for AD that were active as of January 1, 2024, targeting neurotransmitter receptors accounted for 34 ​%, amyloid targeting accounted for 22 ​%, synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection accounted for 12 ​%, neuroinflammation, proteostasis/proteopathies, and metabolism/bioenergetics each accounted for 6 ​%, and tau, postnatal neurogenesis, growth factors/hormones, and circadian rhythm targets each accounted for 3 ​% . However, despite decades of extensive and expensive research, effective treatments for AD patients remain severely limited. While to date two anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, lecanemab and aducanumab, have been approved for patients, they are currently controversial due to high expense, limited ability to slow cognitive decline, and significant risk of dangerous side effects . Sadly, the vast majority (over 99 ​%) of clinical trials in AD to date have shown profound lack of efficacy, highlighting the need to improve discovery of new and effective AD therapies. AD research is receiving increasing attention as the problem grows in magnitude, with different organizations initiating large-scale projects to address this important problem. For example, the nonprofit Brain Health Medicines Center of the Harrington Discovery Institute of University Hospitals of Cleveland is implementing a novel approach to specifically support academic researchers who have made innovative discoveries in AD, outside of the mainstream of biotech and industry, with scientific, industry, and business development expertise to help them traverse the valley of death between academic discovery and commercialization steps required to access the clinic . Other notable efforts include the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS-MAP) , the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD) , and the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) (Table 1). These initiatives, along with databases like the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) , have generated or collected a large amount of data at different dimensions. These include genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, phenomics, and metabolomics. For example, the NIAGADS database includes genomic data (genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data) and phenotypic data, while the SEA-AD, ROSMAP and ssREAD databases provide a large amount of RNA sequencing data including bulk-RNA-seq, single-cell/nuclear RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics data. As well, ADNI includes a variety of clinical data, including imaging data such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Lastly, metabolomic data sets (such as the Human Metabolome Database, HMDB) contain comprehensive analysis of all metabolites in any given biological specimen (i.e. brain, blood, cerebrospinal fluid) to characterize of metabolic derangements in disease and facilitate discovery of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers (Table 1). These massive datasets are the cornerstone of many advanced and emerging technologies.Table 1A list of data resources and tools for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research.Table 1NameOverviewData typeWebsiteReferenceAD knowledge portalComprehensive collection of data, tools, and resources for AD and AD-related dementiaGenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics, and clinical datahttps://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/NIAGADSCentralized data repository of genomic data related to ADGenetic, genomic, and phenotypic datahttps://www.niagads.org/ADNILongitudinal data of neuroimaging and biomarker data for ADMRI and PET scans, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and cognitive assessmentshttps://adni.loni.usc.edu/NCRADBiorepository of AD and other related dementiaDNA, plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and other types of biosampleshttps://ncrad.iu.edu/AlzGPSIntegrative platform for drug discovery and development for ADMulti-omics data, genetic information, and clinical datahttps://alzgps.lerner.ccf.org/TACAComprehensive resource of AD at cellular levelscRNA-seqhttps://taca.lerner.ccf.org/SEA-ADComprehensive resource of multi-omics data at cellular level for ADsnRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, snMultiome, spatial transcriptomicshttps://portal.brain-map.org/explore/seattle-alzheimers-diseasessREADDatabase of sn/scRNA-seq for ADsc/snRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomicshttps://bmblx.bmi.osumc.edu/ssread/scREADDatabase of sn/scRNA-seq for ADscRNA-seq & snRNA-seqhttps://bmbls.bmi.osumc.edu/scread/HMDBHuman metabolome databaseChemical data, clinical data, and molecular biology/biochemistry data.https://hmdb.ca/ The boom in artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI technologies, has greatly accelerated biomarker identification, prediction of disease progression, and identification of drug targets in human disease, including AD [2,, , ]. However, these approaches usually rely on massive amounts of data for overall static prediction, whereas implementing dynamic and personalized models is a challenge. Digital twins (DTs) represent a way to potentially address this challenge. A DT is a virtual representation of a physical individual, process, or system and is already widely used in industries [, , ]. The feature of dynamization and the bi-directional interaction between the virtual realm and reality allows the digital space to be continuously updated in real time in response to the complex physical space . In recent years, the concept of DTs has been introduced to the health and medical fields, and the dynamic and bi-directional interplay between the virtual realm and reality offers promising applications for drug discovery and precision medicine . In this review, we discuss the prospective applications of DTs in predicting AD progression, discovering biomarkers, identifying new drug targets and opportunities for drug repurposing, facilitating clinical trials, and advancing precision medicine.",
        "conclusion": "To summarize, DT technology is already showing great potential application in healthcare, and we propose that it is particularly promising for accelerating drug discovery and development for AD, as well as aspects of personalized precision medicine. However, there are still some limitations for DT in healthcare. DT currently lacks well-defined, systematic theories and algorithms, often relying on existing statistical models and various machine learning approaches. Advancing 10.13039/100001588DT requires a highly interdisciplinary effort: mathematicians and computer scientists are needed to provide foundational theoretical support and develop robust models, while biologists and medical scientists contribute domain expertise to accurately represent biomedical systems. Additionally, the integration of mechanistic modeling, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and other tools is essential to seamlessly connect the virtual and physical worlds, ensuring the fidelity and applicability of DT. It is also important to note that DT validation in biology is more challenging than in industry. One of the main challenges is that biological processes and diseases themselves are not as straightforward as objects in industry, and their inherent complexity complicates multi-scale real-time data collection as well as integration and coordination of data in different dimensions. It should also be noted that sensitive personal health information may be used in constructing DT, and data privacy and data security should be taken into account. Some current advanced techniques, such as federated learning and distributed learning, are methods that can effectively reduce data security issues . In the future, as DT technologies and theories mature, DT has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery in AD and provides patients with more accurate, personalized, and efficient care."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive impairment for which neither treatable nor preventable approaches have been confirmed. Although genetic factors are considered to contribute to sporadic AD, for the majority of AD patients, the exact causes of AD aren't fully understood. For AD genetics, we developed cellular dissection of polygenicity (CDiP) technology to identify the smallest unit of AD, i.e., genetic factors at a cellular level. By CDiP, we found potential therapeutic targets, a rare variant for disease stratification, and polygenes to predict real-world AD by using the real-world data of AD cohort studies (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: ADNI and Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: J-ADNI). In this review, we describe the components and results of CDiP in AD, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) cohort, a cell genome-wide association study (cell GWAS), and machine learning. And finally, we discuss the future perspectives of CDiP technology for reverse engineering of sporadic AD toward AD eradication.",

        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35680997/",
        "introduction": "Neurodegenerative disorder is a pathological condition in which specific cell types gradually degenerate, leading to the disruption of their functions and networks. Among the neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for 60–80% of all dementia cases . There are over 50 million people worldwide living with AD or dementia, and this number is estimated to exceed 100 million by 2050 . With recent developments in biology and genetics, the understanding of various molecular pathologies of dementia has progressed, but at present, there are only limited anti-symptomatic treatments for AD, and there is no curative treatment. To develop therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the causes and their pathophysiology. Among the risk factors for AD, aging, biological gender, and genetic differences provide the strongest evidence . The search for the genetic background of AD was initially advanced by the genetic analysis of large pedigrees with familial AD (FAD). This investigation of FAD revealed mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes, which cause FAD with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. On the other hand, APOE genotype was identified as a genetic background of sporadic AD (SAD), which accounts for 90–95% of all AD cases . Since 2002, genetic case-control studies, called genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have been developed to identify AD-relevant genotypes. In addition, methods such as whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) with larger scales of AD cohorts have been utilized to identify greater numbers of rarer variants . Thus, as the population size of the genetic cohorts grows, the genetic background of AD, which occurs more rarely, has become elucidated. To clarify the relationship between these genotypes and AD pathologies, researchers accumulated experimental results by introducing identified AD-related genes into cell lines and animal models. Such a model has been successful in reproducing one aspect of FAD. However, when introducing AD-related genes into cell-lines or animal models, the amounts of induced genes were several tens of times comparing with that of the physiological state in AD patients. Therefore, there are limitations to applying these cell lines or animal models to the evaluation of compounds or therapies to improve the AD pathology, which originated from the physiological expression patterns of AD-related genes. In fact, anti-AD therapeutics that have been very successful in rodent models have shown little clinical benefit in humans. This disappointing fact highlighted the additional importance of considering the cellular characteristics of human beings and the genetic background of patients for elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms of AD. To understand the genetic background of AD patients, we utilized the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology born in 2006 and established patient-cell-based models of AD . In this section, we reviewed the AD models based on iPSCs to elucidate the genetic involvement of AD pathology and introduced a novel concept to understand the genetic background of SAD cases as well as future perspectives.",
        "conclusion": "More than 15 years have passed since the advent of iPSCs, and now it is possible to conduct iPSC data-driven research to understand the genetics of brain disorders. Reversely, based on the results, iPSC-based disease models enable us to understand the pathological phenotypes originating from genetic backgrounds of AD, and to identify drug candidates with estimations of responsiveness. We look forward to a future where CDiP will contribute to reprogramming a future where AD is precisely predicted, avoided, and eradicated."

        "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) involving tropomyosin kinase B and low affinity p75 neurotropin receptors is the most abundant and researched neurotropins in mammal's brain. It is one of the potential targets for therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease (AD) owing to its key role in synaptic plasticity. Low levels of BDNF are implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological diseases including AD. However, a healthy lifestyle, exercise, and dietary modifications are shown to positively influence insulin regulation in the brain, reduce inflammation, and up-regulate the levels of BDNF, and are thus expected to have roles in AD. In this review, the relationship between BDNF, mental health, and AD is discussed. Insights into the interrelationships between nutrition, lifestyle, and environment with BDNF and possible roles in AD are also provided in the review. The review sheds light on the possible new therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "year": "2022",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35692417/",
        "introduction": "A feature of multifactorial and heterogeneous neurodegenerative (Alzheimer’s disease; AD) is the self-association of neurotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers forming Aβ monomers, which is indicative of abnormal protein processing. AD is the most prevalent (70%) dementia in the western world and is also becoming prevalent in developing countries and thus is a matter of public health concern (Qiu et al., 2007). As per WHO report of 2019, AD is the seventh leading cause of mortality worldwide and by 2050 around 106 million of individuals are expected to be suffering from its worldwide (Brookmeyer et al., 2007). Primitive preclinical AD, Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia are three stages of AD progression as per researchers (Albert et al., 2011; Jack et al., 2011; McKhann et al., 2011; Sperling et al., 2011). Hypertension; metabolic disorders (lipid profile derangements, diabetes, high BMI, and obesity) are implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. Other risk factors include genetics (APOEε4 allele &Val66Met), positive family history, gender, education, and previous history of head trauma (Bendlin et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2011). Apart from the above, metabolic and nutritional factors are also found to be associated with neurological disorders like parkinsonism, seizures, autism and AD (Napoli et al., 2014; Paoli et al., 2014) and thus they all require extensive research with special emphasis on finding and developing therapeutic targets to halt the disease progression and/or provide cure. AD is believed to affect the internal and external functioning of the brain by influencing the physiological processes (Chen et al., 2021). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most abundant and well-studied neurotropin in mammalian brains. Because of its important role in synaptic plasticity, it is one of the potential therapeutic targets in AD. Low BDNF levels have been linked to the pathophysiology of neurological diseases such as AD (Miranda et al., 2019). A healthy lifestyle, exercise, and dietary changes have been shown to positively up-regulate BDNF levels, and are thus expected to play roles in AD (Sleiman et al., 2016; Colucci-D’Amato et al., 2020). The aim of the review article is to provide interaction among nutritional management, lifestyle modifications and BDNF levels in AD patients and look into possible mechanisms/pathways by which these interactions may halt the progression or prevent AD at early stages of life.",
        "conclusion": "Evidence-based research suggests that dietary and lifestyle changes can help people with AD. Calorie restriction has emerged as a potential means of preventing or delaying the onset of AD. Multiple complex pathways that may have both direct and indirect effects on brain physiology are linked to increased insulin secretion, anti-inflammatory effects, and, most importantly, BDNF production by the underlying protective mechanisms. Diet, exercise, and calorie restriction all seem promising because they are non-invasive and have the potential to influence the secretion of factors and hormones, making them candidates for the development of newer regimes in the management and prevention of cognitive impairments and memory loss. However, the beneficial effects may vary with the amount, duration, and intensity of modifications, which is especially true for exercise-induced changes. Thus, long-term prospective studies need to be designed to evaluate the effect of differential intensity of exercise on parameters influencing brain functions like cognition."

        "title": "Human Endogenous Retroviruses as Novel Therapeutic Targets in Neurodegenerative Disorders.",
        "abstract": "Human Endogenous Retroviruses comprise approximately 8% of the human genome, serving as fragments of ancient retroviral infections. Although they are generally maintained in a silenced state by robust epigenetic mechanisms, specific HERV groups, particularly HERV-W and HERV-K, can become derepressed under specific pathological conditions, thereby contributing to the initiation and progression of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. Preclinical studies and clinical trials, such as those investigating monoclonal antibodies, indicate that directly targeting these elements may offer a novel therapeutic strategy. In this review, we provide an overview of HERVs' biology, examine their role in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, and explore their therapeutic prospects, highlighting both the challenges and the potential future research directions needed to translate these approaches into clinical interventions.",
        "year": "2025",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40333317/",
        "introduction": "The human genome is densely populated by transposable elements, including Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs), which represent the genomic remnants of retroviral infections that occurred millions of years ago in our evolutionary ancestors . These retroviral insertions became permanent within the human genome due to integration events in germline cells, thus being transmitted vertically across generations . Over extensive evolutionary timeframes, most HERV elements have undergone a significant accumulation of mutations, leading to their transcriptional silencing and loss of coding ability . Moreover, cellular epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA interference, efficiently suppress most of these sequences, maintaining genomic stability and preventing potentially harmful gene activation . Despite their generally dormant state, several HERVs retain intact or partially intact regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, and polyadenylation signals, as well as, in some circumstances, open reading frames (ORFs) capable of generating functional transcripts and proteins . These regulatory sequences allow HERVs to influence gene expression patterns, either through direct transcriptional interference, modulation of neighboring genes, or alteration of chromatin architecture . Emerging evidence underscores the biological significance of these residual elements, revealing that their controlled reactivation plays critical roles in normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, placental function, and immune system modulation . However, the aberrant reactivation of specific HERV families has been increasingly implicated in pathological conditions , particularly in the context of neurological diseases . Recent studies have drawn significant attention to the role of HERV-K, especially the HML-2 subtype and HERV-W families, correlating their abnormal activation with enhanced neuroinflammatory responses and progressive neurodegeneration . Elevated expression of HERV-K transcripts and proteins has been detected in the brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with ALS , suggesting a pathogenic contribution through inflammatory cascades and neurotoxicity mediated by the envelope protein . Similarly, the HERV-W-env protein has been prominently observed within the active lesions of patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS), directly contributing to microglial activation, neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neuronal damage . Additional studies have associated increased HERV activation with Alzheimer′s disease and schizophrenia, reinforcing the idea that deregulated HERV expression may constitute a common pathogenic mechanism underlying various neurological disorders .",
        "conclusion": "Despite the promising preclinical findings and innovative therapeutic strategies currently being explored, targeting HERVs in the neurodegenerative disorders presents several challenges that must be addressed before the clinical implementation. One of the critical challenges is the complexity of selectively targeting specific HERV sequences within the human genome. Given that HERVs constitute a significant portion of the genome, with numerous closely related sequences dispersed across multiple chromosomes, achieving the necessary specificity to selectively silence or neutralize pathogenic elements, while avoiding the disruption of non-pathogenic or physiologically beneficial HERV sequences, remains a technical challenge. Additionally, there is still a limited understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the activation and silencing of HERVs across different cell types, especially within the complex microenvironment of the central nervous system. The regulation of HERV elements involves different aspects, including epigenetic control, transcription factor interactions, chromatin remodeling, and environmental influences. Another key challenge is the patient-specific variability of HERV activation in different neurological disorders. Factors like genetic makeup, epigenetic modifications, environmental factors, and stages of disease progression can all affect how HERVs are activated in individual patients. This variability highlights the importance of creating personalized diagnostic methods to detect and track HERV activity, along with reliable biomarkers to evaluate treatment effectiveness and anticipate possible side effects or resistance."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and its prevalence is increasing. Nowadays, very few drugs effectively reduce AD symptoms and thus, a better understanding of its pathophysiology is vital to design new effective schemes. Presymptomatic neuronal damage caused by the accumulation of Amyloid β peptide and Tau protein abnormalities remains a challenge, despite recent efforts in drug development. Importantly, therapeutic targets, biomarkers, and diagnostic techniques have emerged to detect and treat AD. Of note, the compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) and peripheral inflammation in AD are becoming more evident, being harmful factors that contribute to the development of the disease. Perspectives from different pre-clinical and clinical studies link peripheral inflammation with the onset and progression of AD. This review aims to analyze the main factors and the contribution of impaired BBB in AD development. Additionally, we describe the potential therapeutic strategies using stem cells for AD treatment.",
        "year": "2022",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36077533/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia; it is a progressive cognitive and functional impairment with memory loss that affects over 40 million people worldwide . AD incidence is expected to increase in the coming years; most cases are sporadic and of late-onset, without presenting a proven hereditability . The prevalence increases with life expectancy and affects 10–30% of people over 65 years of age . AD displays a complex etiology that represents a great challenge to elucidate the mechanisms that trigger its onset. However, multiple research groups have provided important insights regarding the biological mechanisms that cause AD. The most prevalent hypothesis about the onset of AD is the deposition of Amyloid-beta (Aβ) fragments that induce neurotoxicity and, ultimately, neuronal death . However, another possible cause widely accepted is the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) derived from the hyperphosphorylation of Tau , a protein that organizes cytoskeletal elements of neurons. Although Aβ and Tau alterations have a significant role in AD, its complexity implicates other essential factors that contribute to its manifestation . Recently, it has been proposed that alterations related to AD include the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the activation of the innate immune system, which has an essential role at its onset and progression . Here we mainly analyzed the role of BBB impairment and how this can be used to treat AD.",
        "conclusion": "AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment. BBB impairment could be exploited as a gate towards the CNS in order to deliver therapeutic agents more efficiently. Blood-borne factors and stem cells can be an effective option because of their neuroprotective and regenerative potential, but their mechanism of action is still under investigation, although many preclinical studies suggest positive results. A combination of stem cell therapy, whether transplanted or as a vehicle for therapeutic molecules, and the administration of well-identified blood-borne factors could be a complementary therapeutic strategy to the current drugs."

As there is still no cure for AD, the growth in the number of susceptible individuals represents a major emerging threat to public health. Currently, the pathogenesis and etiology of AD remain poorly understood, while no efficient treatments are available to slow down the degenerative effects of AD. Metabolomics allows the study of biochemical alterations in pathological processes which may be involved in AD progression and to discover new therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarized and analyzed the results from studies on metabolomics analysis performed in biological samples of AD subjects and AD animal models. Then this information was analyzed by using MetaboAnalyst to find the disturbed pathways among different sample types in human and animal models at different disease stages. We discuss the underlying biochemical mechanisms involved, and the extent to which they could impact the specific hallmarks of AD. Then we identify gaps and challenges and provide recommendations for future metabolomics approaches to better understand AD pathogenesis.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in aging population, leads to the progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions . In 1907, Dr. Alois Alzheimer discovered the first patient with senile plaques and NFTs, which represent the major hallmarks of AD which has become a major public health problem due to the increase in the elder population worldwide . AD can be divided into two types: familial AD (5%) and sporadic AD (95%). Familial AD (FAD) has an early onset (<65 years of age) and it is caused by mutations in the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) . Age is a major risk factor for AD, but inactivity (lack of exercise), obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and too high alcohol consumption also increase the incidence of AD. Furthermore, it seems that low educational level, social isolation, and cognitive inactivity also contributes to AD . Today, diagnosis of AD is based on several neuropsychological tests, imaging, and biological analyses, which all indicate AD in a later stage. Currently, there is no efficient treatment available, although treatment by the recently approved drug lecanemab seems to delay AD progression , and provides some hope. Currently, we know that brain extracellular amyloid deposits, called neuritic senile or amyloid-β plaques, and fibrillary protein deposits inside neurons, known as neurofibrillary bundles or tau tangles, appear mainly in the frontal and temporal lobes and contribute to AD progression . However, there are still many questions about how AD initiates and how it progresses. Information on factors in and mechanism of initiation and progression, therefore, is crucial for earlier diagnosis, as well as to find targets to treat AD in a stage-dependent manner. AD is very complex, and a systems biological approach is warranted. Metabolomics allows such an approach as it can be used to measure biochemical alterations underlying pathological processes thus offering great potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. This is because a subject’s metabolome reflects alterations in genetic, transcript, and protein profiles as well as influences from the environment . Moreover, since metabolic pathways are largely conserved between species, metabolomics could improve the translation of preclinical research conducted in animal models of AD into humans. Furthermore, the brain has a high lipid content, which indicates that lipidomics may be a highly valuable omics technique as well, to provide novel insights into AD pathogenesis. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of application of metabolomics (including lipidomics) research on AD in human and animal models, together with the metabolite information that has been obtained from plasma, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples in human studies and animal studies. We then analyze this information using MetaboAnalyst to find the disturbed pathways among different sample types in human and animal models of different disease stages. Then we identify gaps and challenges and provide recommendations for future metabolomics approaches to better understand AD pathogenesis.",
        "conclusion": "Considering the dramatic aging of populations worldwide, it is of great importance to explore AD pathogenesis. Metabolic changes associated with AD progression occur prior to the development of clinical symptoms; metabolomics by itself or in conjunction with the additional currently available biomarkers for AD diagnosis could serve as an additional tool to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, to predict the disease progression, and to monitor the efficacy of therapeutic intervention. Metabolomic studies have demonstrated the dramatic impact of AD pathogenesis and progression on metabolites and related metabolic pathways, including energy-related metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, abnormal lipid metabolism, altered amino acids metabolism (e.g., arginine, glutamate), and some others. In the present review, we summarized the metabolomics studies that were performed in biological samples of AD subjects and AD mouse models. The results of rats were too sparse and not suitable for further analysis. The mouse research shows that 12- and 24-months, middle and old age in AD mouse models, can be equivalated to the MCI and AD late stage in humans, respectively. As obtaining human body samples is costly, limited in possible samples sites by ethics (i.e., brain), and time-consuming for the long life span of humans, the above indicates that animal research may be considered a valuable addition, as it can be designed in a longitudinal fashion and with samples from multiple sites of the body to obtain time-course information and interrelationships, to gain insights that support research on AD in humans. The disturbed pathways by AD were analyzed based on metabolite data collected from the literature. Eight disturbed metabolic pathways were found in common between AD mouse research and AD human research. These pathways are alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, β-Alanine metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, histidine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. Our analysis of the literature studies has several limitations. The coverage of metabolites varied among different studies due to the detection sensitivity differences, as analytical platforms (e.g., NMR, GC-MS, LC-MS) and analytical methods are diverse in different laboratories. In addition, it is hard to reproduce various metabolomics results because of different sample sources (brain tissue or plasma) from either deceased or living patients and diverse distribution about sex, age, and suffering from other diseases. Moreover, the methods used for obtaining samples, such as CSF and brain, varied among different studies. For example, delays between removing and freezing animal or human brain tissue can affect metabolomics analysis. Altogether, in this review, we summarized and analyzed existing metabolomics data and the relation between plasma, CSF, and brain for animals and plasma and CSF for human data. We identified missing longitudinal information, which would be difficult to be obtained from humans (high costs, long direction) while also in the human brain cannot be sampled. Longitudinal and multi-body site information, however, is important to understand the processes in AD. This is where animal research may support AD research in humans to provide new insights on disease biomarkers patterns and biological pathways, that will support AD stage diagnosis in humans but also the discovery of AD future therapeutic targets."

        "abstract": "The contribution of organelles to neural development has received increasing attention. Studies have shown that organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomes, and endosomes play important roles in neurogenesis. Specifically, metabolic switching, reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, and the interaction between mitochondria and the ER all have roles in neurogenesis. Lysosomes and endosomes can regulate neurite growth and extension. Moreover, metabolic reprogramming represents a novel strategy for generating functional neurons. Accordingly, the exploration and application of mechanisms underlying metabolic reprogramming will be beneficial for neural conversion and regenerative medicine. There is adequate evidence implicating the dysfunction of cellular organelles-especially mitochondria-in neurodegenerative disorders, and that improvement of mitochondrial function may reverse the progression of these diseases through the reinforcement of adult neurogenesis. Therefore, these organelles have potential as therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the function of these organelles, especially mitochondria, in neural development, focusing on their potential as therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

        "introduction": "Neural development is a complex process that requires various endogenous and exogenous signals to generate connected neural circuits with specific functions. During embryonic neurogenesis, the folding of the neural plate forms the neural tube, followed by the formation of temporarily and spatially regulated morphogen gradients along the anterior–posterior (A–P) and dorsal–ventral (D–V) axes (Tao and Zhang, 2016). In A–P patterning, WNT, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and retinoic acid (RA) gradients predominate in forebrain, mid-hindbrain, and spinal cord segmentation; while WNT, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and sonic hedgehog (Shh) gradients regulate D–V patterning, i.e., for ventralization and dorsalization of the developing nervous system (Tao and Zhang, 2016). Once brain tissue maturation is complete, the number of neural stem cells (NSCs) decreases, maintaining multipotency, i.e., the ability to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in limited regions of the brain. NSCs are located in two main neurogenic niches in the adult mammalian brain, namely, the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) within the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (Figures 1A,B; Bond et al., 2015). NSCs remain quiescent until they receive activation signals, when they then enter the cell cycle. After activation, NSCs can perform two types of division, symmetric or asymmetric. In the former, NSCs divide into two NSCs or two progenitor cells, while in asymmetric division they divide into an NSC and a progenitor cell (Figure 1C; Bond et al., 2015). The progenitor cells will later proliferate, migrate, differentiate into specific cell types, and integrate into the neural circuits (Vieira et al., 2018). These processes are regulated by a variety of endogenous and exogenous cues, including growth factors, morphogen-mediated signaling pathways, transcription factors, extracellular matrix (ECM), glial cells, and perineuronal nets (PNNs) (Vieira et al., 2018; Cope and Gould, 2019). To date, various methods have been developed to investigate neurogenesis in vitro. Forced expression of neural lineage-determining transcription factors; treatment with small molecules, growth factors, and neurotrophic factors; and even three-dimensional (3D) cell culture methods have all been applied to induce functional neurons from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) or somatic cells (Yang et al., 2011; Gascon et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2018; Vieira et al., 2018). An alternative method with huge potential for cell lineage regulation that has also been explored is metabolic reprogramming. Cellular metabolism can influence cell proliferation and lineage commitment by promoting the epigenetic modification of histones and DNA (Ly et al., 2020). Additionally, during somatic cell reprogramming, cells undergo a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis, accompanied by changes in the morphology and number of mitochondria (Nishimura et al., 2019). Importantly, the forced expression of LIN28A can activate pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1)-mediated glycolysis/tricarboxylic acid (TCA)/OXPHOS uncoupling, thus inducing metabolic reprogramming from OXPHOS to glycolysis and the reprogramming of mitochondria into a fused, more functional state in somatic stem cells (SSCs) (Pieknell et al., 2021). This process may enhance the self-renewal and differentiation potential of SSCs in regenerative medicine (Pieknell et al., 2021). Therefore, focusing on the potential of various organelles and their mechanistic roles in neurogenesis could expand the repertoire of methods for neurogenesis in vitro, especially through metabolic reprogramming. There is adequate evidence supporting that organelle dysfunction is strongly associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mitochondria dysfunction is found in AD patients, including disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics, disturbed mitochondrial genomic homeostasis, and increased oxidative stress (Wang et al., 2020). Mitochondria-related dysfunction is also involved in PD, mainly through respiratory chain impairment, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations, and dysregulation of mitophagy, through mutations in Parkin and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) in familial PD (Monzio Compagnoni et al., 2020). Moreover, studies have suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction may play an important role in AD and PD via the dysregulation of adult neurogenesis (Richetin et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018). Other organelles such as the ER, lysosomes, and endosomes are also correlated with neurodegenerative diseases (Hetz and Saxena, 2017; Pensalfini et al., 2020; Root et al., 2021). In this review, we focus on the function of organelles, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomes, and endosomes, in neural development, and discuss their potential as therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "conclusion": "Future studies should focus on determining whether metabolic reprogramming targeting mitochondria can help to generate functional neurons. For instance, suppressing PI3K using LY294002 can increase the mitochondrial membrane potential and promote the differentiation of mNSCs and human dermal stem cells (hDSCs) into TUJ1-positive, neuron-like cells with electrophysiological activity (Liu et al., 2019). During this process, metabolism switches from glycolysis to OXPHOS with a parallel increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial ROS production (Liu et al., 2019). Moreover, mitochondria-associated proteins may serve as markers for assessing the extent of neuroectodermal differentiation. The mRNA expression of CHCHD2, a mitochondrial protein, was found to be decreased in human iPSCs relative to that in human ESCs (Zhu et al., 2016). This difference will reduce the ability of human iPSCs to differentiate along a neural lineage as lower CHCHD2 levels equate to reduced sequestration of SMAD4 in mitochondria and, consequently, a failure to inhibit the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway (Zhu et al., 2016). This implies that mitochondrial proteins may also represent promising targets for enhancing neural differentiation in human iPSCs. Although several drugs that target organelles have been developed, it is necessary to identify additional drugs with improved safety and efficiency. With the rapid development of high-throughput screening technology, the design of probes precisely targeting specific organelles can greatly improve drug screening efficiency. For example, Cen et al. (2020) screened 2,024 drug candidates or FDA-approved drugs and identified UMI-77 as an activator of mitophagy with potential for use in AD treatment. During the screening process, the authors used a HEK293T cell line stably expressing mt-Keima (Cen et al., 2020). Keima is a coral-derived protein that exhibits shorter-wavelength (green) excitation in mitochondria (pH 8.0) and longer-wavelength (red) excitation in lysosomes (pH 4.5), and is resistant to lysosome degradation (Sun et al., 2017). Recently, another mitophagy probe was developed, called mito-SARI, which displayed improved resistance to fixation. This probe was used to identify T-271, an enhancer of mitophagy, in a large-scale-based high-throughput screen of 76,000 candidates (Katayama et al., 2020). This compound could also induce mitophagy in a Parkin-dependent manner without damaging mitochondria, rendering it and its derivatives potential therapeutic options for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Katayama et al., 2020). In conclusion, it is foreseeable that targeting organelles for neural conversion in regenerative medicine and drug screening will lead to improvements in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."

        "title": "Herbal medicines in Alzheimer's disease and the involvement of gut microbiota.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. It severely affects the quality of life of victims. The prevalence of AD has been increasing in recent years. Therefore, it is of great importance to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of AD and search for effective therapeutic approaches. Gut microbiota dysbiosis, an altered state of gut microbiota, has been well known for its involvement in the pathogenesis of AD. Much effort has been made in searching for approaches capable of modulating the composition of gut microbiota in recent years. Herbal medicines have attracted extensive attention in recent decades for the prevention and treatment of AD. Here, we gave an overview of the recent research progress on the modulatory effects of herbal medicines and herbal formulae on gut microbiota as well as the possible beneficial effects on AD, which may provide new insights into the discovery of anti-AD agents and their therapeutic potential for AD through modulating the composition of gut microbiota.",
        "year": "2024",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39081953/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease, one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability, and death in the elderly, is an irreversible neurodegenerative condition. It is estimated that a large number of elderly people are living with AD nowadays and the prevalence and incidence of AD is continuing to grow as the population ages (Cui et al., 2020; ALZHEIMER S ASSOCIATION REPORT, 2021). This brings a heavy burden to both their families and the healthcare system (Agudelo-Botero et al., 2023). AD is characterized by specific pathological hallmarks, including extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques (Paroni et al., 2019), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation (Twarowski and Herbet, 2023) in the central nervous system (CNS). The innate immune system cells are vital in regulating brain homeostasis and can eliminate Aβ plaques and aggregated Tau proteins, while abnormal activation of these cells can result in programmed cell death, release of proinflammatory cytokines and consequently chronic neuroinflammation, as well as inhibit phagocytosis of Aβ aggregates and lead to Aβ aggregates accumulation. The inflammatory responses are mainly carried out by two key glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes (Rajesh and Kanneganti, 2022). The abnormal activation of microglia and astrocyte can release cytokines which can activate downstream target genes like NF-κB and AP-1 and elicit neurotoxicity like neuronal death (Singh, 2022). It is a complex condition that involves many pathological pathways from synaptic loss, deficient neurotransmission, progressive accumulation of amyloid proteins to tau toxicity (Khan et al., 2020). However, there is still no cure for AD. FDA has aproved 5 drugs for AD, including donepezil (Adlimoghaddam et al., 2018), rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine, and combine donepezil with memantine (Joe and Ringman, 2019). But they can only relieve symptoms without any disease-modifying effects. It is under great demand to find efficacious strategies that can significantly prevent or slow the progression of AD (Passeri et al., 2022). At the moment, a number of promising therapeutic strategies are undergoing clinical trials, including synaptic dysfunction modifying agents, neurotransmission modifying agents, anti-amyloid agents, anti-tau agents (Cummings et al., 2019), as well as anti-inflammatory agents. Due to the complicated nature of AD, it is more promising to seek for multitarget therapies which can be more beneficial by interfering with multiple pathological processes (Cummings et al., 2022; Ju and Tam, 2022). Herbal medicine is one of these therapies for AD. AD can be attributed to a combination of multiple factors, including unmodifiable risk factors, such as age, genetics, and family history of AD, as well as modifiable risk factors, such as physical activity (Sabia et al., 2017), smoking, low education level, body weight, and blood sugar (Livingston et al., 2020). Gut microbiota dysbiosis has attracted much attention as a novel therapeutic target for AD in the last few years. In this review, we will focus on the possible connections between AD, microbiota dysbiosis and herbal medicine.",
        "conclusion": "The multi-target beneficial effects of herbs or herbal formulae in the treatment of AD have been extensively elucidated and the associated mechanisms are gradually revealed and validated. More and more evidence also supports the regulatory roles of herbs or herbal formulae in modulating the gut microbiota. After herbs or herbal formulae enter the gut, they are transformed and absorbed into the body, thereby exerting the complicated effects through the circulation system. At the same time, ingredients of herbs or herbal formulae interact with the gut microbiota and to some extent influence the composition of microbiota in the gut. Based on this understanding, it is reasonable to postulate that the direct influence of herbal components on gut microbiota could have secondary effects on the host through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. As interactions between gut microbiota and AD also have been well-documented, the secondary effects exerted by altered gut microbiota may be an essential part of the neuroprotective mechanisms of herbs in ameliorating cognitive impairment in AD. We reviewed commonly used herbs or herbal formulae for AD and their neuroprotective mechanisms, which were previously evaluated. Meanwhile, the effects of some herbs or herbal formulae on regulating gut microbiota were studied and the importance of herbs or herbal formulae in protecting against AD through modulating gut microbiota was elucidated. However, some herbs or herbal formulae have not been studied on their possible associations with gut microbiota, which may be the next step to further explore their neuroprotective mechanisms against AD in future studies. We also reviewed some herbs which have been shown to regulate gut microbiota. Specific gut microbesregulated by different herbal formulae, herbal extracts or herbs are shown in Table 5. Based on connections of gut microbiota with AD, herbal components may have secondary effects on the brain by affecting gut microbiota through regulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis, thereby influencing cognitive functions of the host. Herbal formulae or extracts of herbs modulate the composition of the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria or decreasing the abundance of harmful bacteria, leading to an increased level of SCFA or decreased level of inflammatory cytokines. This further brings benefits to the function of the local intestinal barrier and the distal central nervous system, subsequently alleviating blood-brain barrier alterations, β-aggregates, plaque accumulation, neuronal loss and neuroinflammation through the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and consequently slow down the progression of AD. The impact of herbs or herbal formulae on gut microbiota and their subsequent effect on AD progression is shown in Figure 5. Herbs or extracts from herbs are able to regulate the composition of the gut microbiota and they may be beneficial in protecting against AD through multiple pathogenic processes, so it is more attractive to find multipotent agents that can hit more than one target and exert better AD-preventing effects. Herbs, as naturally existing agents containing multipotent anti-AD compounds, are attracting much attention from the field. Emerging evidence supports the use of herbal medicine for the treatment of AD, however, there is still a lack of direct evidence on the effect of herbal medicine on the composition of the gut microbiota in AD. Some herbal formulae or individual herbs have already been commonly used for treating age-related dementia. Therefore, medicinal herbs capable of modulating gut microbiota may become potential therapeutic candidates for AD. A diversity of bioactive compounds from herbal medicines are mainly responsible for the anti-AD effects, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, Rosmarinic acid, xanthones (Gong et al., 2020). As they are capable of regulating the balance of the gut microbiota, it is postulated that these herbal medicines may improve AD by targeting the composition of gut microbiota. Though there is evidence supporting the use of herbal medicines in the prevention and treatment of AD, clinical evidence of their effectiveness, especially from phase II and III clinical trials, is still in its infancy. The universal use of herbs in the management of AD patients needs to be evaluated in clinical trials like FDA approved drugs. Evidence supports the beneficial effect of herbal medicine for the treatment of AD, but some obstacles can not be neglected for the application of herbal medicine. As the compounds in herbs are complex, the mechanisms of action, specific features of metabolism of some compounds are still not elucidated. Thus, metabolomics may be a promising method to better explore active ingredients and to clarify mechanisms and metabolic pathways of herbal medicine from a molecule metabolism level (Ren et al., 2023). Besides, herbs and herbal ingredients usually were transformed into metabolites with a higher bioavailability and activities by the gut microbiota after entering into the gut. To better explore the activities and mechanisms of metabolites of herbal ingredients, a novel strategy is proposed which involves spectrum-effect relationship analysis, network pharmacology, metabolomics analysis and molecular docking. To be specific, the herb and bioactive metabolites were screened through spectrum-effect relationship analysis firstly. Network pharmacology and metabolomics analysis were utilized to identify the upstream key targets of the herb and its metabolites as well as the downstream endogenous metabolites secondly. Lastly, the active forms of herbs were further confirmed by molecular docking (Zhong et al., 2023). However, as the biotransformation of the herbal ingredients is also very complicated, it remains a challenge to confirm the activities and mechanisms of the metabolites of herbal ingredients. Compared with synthetic drugs, herbal plants and bioactive compounds are superior with regard to safety, however, the safety aspect of medicinal plants and bioactive candidates needs to be assessed through animal studies and clinical trials to develop evidence-based medicines for AD."

        "title": "Network pharmacology identify intersection genes of quercetin and Alzheimer's disease as potential therapeutic targets.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no efficient therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) among the elderly, although it is the most common etiology of dementia among the elderly. Quercetin, which has a variety of therapeutic properties, may pave the way for novel approaches to AD treatment. In the AD patients' frontal cortex, current study aims to identify the potential mechanisms of quercetin's pharmacological targets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacological targets of quercetin have been studied from DrugBank and SwissTarget. In order to distinguish AD-associated genes targeted by quercetin (Q-ADGs), we utilized an integrated intersection of gene expressions of the frontal cortex in combination with transcriptome analysis. To detect cortex-related Q-ADGs and immune-related Q-ADGs, a drug screening database and the immune infiltration analysis was utilized. The Q-ADGs were then linked with the AD severity scores (MMSE scores) to find severity-associated Q-ADGs. In addition, the miRNA-seq datasets were examined to identify severity-associated Q-ADG-miRNAs. Twelve genes, more frequently related to AD by previous studies among all the genes identified in the present study, were subjected to the verification of qRT-PCR in AD cell model. RESULTS: In the frontal lobe of AD, 207 Q-ADGs were discovered and found that axonogenesis, glial differentiation, and other biological processes had been enriched. There were 155 immune-related Q-ADGs (e.g., COX2, NOS2, HMGB1) and 65 cortex-related Q-ADGs (e.g., FOXO1, CXCL16, NOTCH3). Sixteen Q-ADGs (e.g., STAT3, RORA, BCL6) and 28 miRNAs (e.g., miR-142-5p, miR-17-5p) were found to be related to MMSE scores. In the qRT-PCR results, six out of twelve genes were significantly regulated by quercetin. DYRK1A, FOXO1, NOS2, NGF, NQO1, and RORA genes were novel target of quercetin in AD. DYRK1A, NOS2, and NQO1 genes targeted by quercetin have benefits in the treatment of AD. However, FOXO1, NGF, and RORA genes targeted by quercetin might have a negative impact on AD. CONCLUSION: The role of quercetin in AD appears to be multifaceted, and it can affect patients' frontal cortex in a variety of pathways, such as axonogenesis, immune infiltration, and glial cell differentiation. DYRK1A, NOS2, and NQO1 might be potential novel effective drug targets for quercetin in AD.",

        "introduction": "People with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) suffer gradually declining cognitive function, personality changes, and psychiatric symptoms. AD is the leading cause of age-related dementia worldwide (Wang et al., 2009). There is still uncertainty as to how AD develops, since it is a complicated neurodegenerative disorder (Wang et al., 2018). However, genetic changes may be prevalent causes of early-onset familial AD (FAD), such as mutation in the presenilin or amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene causing the most frequent and aggressive forms of FAD (Athan et al., 2001; Dewachter and Van Leuven, 2002; Bergmans and De Strooper, 2010). At the genetic level, significant progress has been made in understanding AD’s etiology (Damjanac et al., 2009; Campion et al., 2019; Ułamek-Kozioł et al., 2020; Zhang X. et al., 2020). To date, AD is mostly resistant to conventional therapies. Therefore, therapeutic drug may be developed targeting AD on the basis of pathological, biochemical and genetic evidence. Quercetin, a plant-derived flavonoid, has been found as a promising antioxidant and antiinflammatory molecule (Katsarou et al., 2000; Panicker et al., 2010). Quercetin has been demonstrated to decrease the immune response in a variety of immunological-related disorders, including experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and even infection with COVID-19 (Muthian and Bright, 2004; Zheng et al., 2021). Quercetin’s efficacy in treating experimental EAE is often linked to its ability to inhibit Th1 differentiation and IL-12 signaling (Muthian and Bright, 2004). Additionally, quercetin has therapeutic benefits on neurodegenerative illnesses by modulating a variety of proteins including Bcl-2, PARP, Bax, COX2, NF-kB, STAT3, chemokines, and cytokines (Ghafouri-Fard et al., 2021; Zingales et al., 2021). Recently, quercetin has been shown to prevent pathologies and promote neuroprotective effect in the therapy of AD by relieving functional and cognitive symptoms (Qi et al., 2020). In vivo and in vitro, numerous investigations shown that quercetin improves the clearance of aberrant proteins, such as β-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, which are important pathologic markers of AD (Suganthy et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2020). A lipophilic compound known as quercetin penetrated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in experiments with animal models of degenerative diseases (M S and C D, 2017; Orhan, 2021). This indicates quercetin has direct effects on the central nervous system (CNS). A number of studies have implicated quercetin in a number of activities, including mitophagy, inhibition of microglia and astrocyte activation, regulation of the inflammatory response in dendritic cells, and inhibition of neuronal death (Han et al., 2021). Given that these processes of pathophysiology had been identified in AD patients, it was hypothesized that quercetin may also have therapeutic benefits on AD patients’ pathogenic processes. Recently, more and more novel approaches, such as Connectivity Map and microarray data (Iyaswamy et al., 2020), have been used to identify drug therapeutic targets targeting AD. Until yet, most of previous research on AD animal models studied on how quercetin had exerted its impact on the metabolism of the aggregation of β-amyloid protein and APP (Halevas et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). However, a lot of AD models do not accurately mimic real illness, especially late-onset disease. As a result, direct study on human brain tissue is required for AD research. However, there is presently no evidence proving quercetin’s function in AD patients’ brain tissue. The network pharmacology provides a novel tool for identifying successful medication components and pathways, as well as a more complete comprehension of the pharmacological effects of pharmaceuticals in particular disorders. Additionally, this approach enables direct examination of brain tissue. The network pharmacological approach was utilized in this research to investigate the possible pharmacological targets and mechanism of quercetin in the treatment of AD.",
        "conclusion": "In the elderly, as the most prevalent type of dementia, AD presents a number of challenges to those who suffer from it (Babatope et al., 2021). Quercetin was recently found to be an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, and perhaps therapeutic agent for COVID-19 in the prevention and neuroprotection of histopathology in AD animal models, but its efficacy in human brain tissue has not been established (Saeedi-Boroujeni and Mahmoudian-Sani, 2021). The purpose of this research was to develop network pharmacology to discover potential quercetin medication targets in the CNS of AD patients. We discovered that quercetin may ameliorate pathological events by altering astrocytes, microglia, the infiltration of B cells naive, T cells follicular helper, Monocytes, Macrophages M1, Mast cells resting, B cells memory, T cells CD4 naïve and Dendritic cells activated in the frontal cortices, biological process of axonogenesis, glial cell differentiation, gliogenesis, axon guidance, neuron projection guidance, KEGG pathway of MAPK signaling pathway, axon guidance, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, and miRNA interactions, among others (Figure 10). DYRK1A gene was involved in neuronal development and serves a number of functions in the adult CNS (Park et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2012; Pathak et al., 2018). DYRK1A mRNA and protein level were significantly upregulated in AD patients brains, including in the hippocampus (Kimura et al., 2007; Velazquez et al., 2019). DYRK1A overexpression may contribute to the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD and Down syndrome patients (Park et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2012; Pathak et al., 2018). By phosphorylating PS1 and reducing phosphatidylcholine concentrations, upregulated DYRK1A may contribute to AD pathogenesis (Ryu et al., 2010; Hijazi et al., 2017). Up-regulated DYRK1A downregulate neprilysin which was a major Aβ-degrading enzyme to reduce the pathological process of Aβ aggregation in AD (Kawakubo et al., 2017). DYRK1A increased phosphorylation of tau, APP, and PSEN1, which are three key proteins in AD pathologic process (Wegiel et al., 2011; Branca et al., 2017). In several experimental models of systemic autoimmunity and mucosal inflammation, T regulatory cells (Treg) induced by DYRK1A inhibitors significantly reduced inflammation (Khor et al., 2015). Normalizing DYRK1A gene expression in a mouse model improves numerous AD phenotypes (García-Cerro et al., 2017). The qRT-PCR results in the present study have revealed that quercetin significantly downregulated DYRK1A mRNA expression in AD cell model (p < 0.005) (Figure 9A). Inhibition of DYRK1A hyperactivity in AD by quercetin in the brain may pave the way for therapies on cognitive decline in AD patients (Smith et al., 2012; Branca et al., 2017; Pathak et al., 2018). Oxidative stress and AD are linked together by forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) (Paroni et al., 2014; Zhang W. et al., 2020). FOXO1 overexpression reduced both tau phosphorylation and Aβ expression (Zhang W. et al., 2020). FOXO1 has been shown to activate autophagy by suppressing mTOR (Zhao et al., 2010). A signaling pathway involving IL-7/CD127 was activated by FOXO1, which enhanced Treg cell proliferation (Cai et al., 2017). FOXO1 overexpression reduces inflammation and boosts anti-oxidative capability (Huang et al., 2019). However, contrary to the result in decidualized endometrial stromal cells (Kusama et al., 2021), we found that quercetin significantly decreases FOXO1 mRNA level in AD cell model (p < 0.005) (Figure 9B), which indicates that FOXO1, downregulated by quercetin, may play a bad role. In AD, the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) was increased (Kummer et al., 2012). There has been a connection between NOS2 and the risk of AD or dementia associated with Lewy bodies (Singleton et al., 2001). The activation of the inducible NOS2, which results in increased NO production, which partly leads to the inflammatory response in AD (Kummer et al., 2011). NOS2 isoforms associated with inflammation in brain glial cells are believed to contribute to neurological disorder etiology and progression (Murphy et al., 2002). There was a significant TH17 immune response increase, along with matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression, associated with increased expression of inducible NOS2 (Sodenkamp et al., 2011). NOS2-specific inhibitors diminish inflammation in mice (Weinberg, 2000). The qRT-PCR results in the present study have revealed that quercetin significantly downregulated NOS2 mRNA expression in AD cell model (p < 0.05) (Figure 9C). There was a significant reduction in the amount of 3’-nitrotyrosine Aβ (3NTyr10-Aβ), overall Aβ deposition and cognition impairments in APP/PS1 animals with a NOS2 deficiency or with oral therapy with the NOS2 inhibitor (Kummer et al., 2011; Irwin et al., 2016). NQO1, having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory function (SantaCruz et al., 2004; Mokarizadeh et al., 2020), is declined in AD patients’ and mice’s brains (Torres-Lista et al., 2014; Osama et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The NQO1 produces anti-oxidative types of ubiquinone and vitamin E, which contribute to antioxidant protection as well as dopaminergic neuronal tolerance to chronic oxidative damage (Ross et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2019). NQO1 is modulated by Nrf2 gene which contributes to the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis, regulates inflammation and provides neuroprotection against both Aβ and p-tau (Osama et al., 2020). The qRT-PCR results in the present study have revealed that quercetin significantly upregulated NQO1 mRNA expression in AD cell model (p < 0.001) (Figure 9E). Increased NQO1 activity may be neuroprotective for AD patients (Osama et al., 2020). In PC12 cells, Nerve growth factor (NGF) increases APP mRNA levels through a process that most likely includes Ras activation, and is likely regulated by particular APP promoter sequences (Villa et al., 2001). In AD patients, NGF level is markedly higher in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cholinergic neuron target areas such as the hippocampus and cortex (Hock et al., 2000; Fahnestock et al., 2001; Du et al., 2018). The qRT-PCR results in the present study have revealed that quercetin significantly downregulated NGF mRNA expression in AD cell model (p < 0.05) (Figure 9D). Although some studies suggested that NGF prevented cholinergic degeneration and memory deficits (Wu et al., 2004; Fjord-Larsen et al., 2010), proper reduction of the hyperactive NGF by quercetin in AD might benefit for AD patients. Three immune cells demonstrated significant differences via immune infiltration analysis: T cells CD4 naïve, T cells follicular helper, and Dendritic cells activated. Respectively, 101 gene targets were related to immune cells among immune-related Q-ADGs. Up-regulated genes (STAT3, etc.) were positively correlated with T cells CD4 naïve, and negatively correlated with T cells follicular helper and Dendritic cells activated. On the opposite, down-regulated genes (SMAD3, etc.) were negatively correlated with T cells CD4 naïve, and positively correlated with T cells follicular helper and Dendritic cells activated. We proposed that these up- or down-regulated genes had a more direct association with immunological infiltration. COX-2 is increased and has been confirmed to participate in the pathogenesis of AD. These up- or down-regulated genes were consistent with the increase of the astrocyte-associated genes in the brain of AD patients in comparison with controls. An immune cell-regulated enzyme in the brain, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), is produced in neuron as a result of synaptic excitatory activity and inflammation (Woodling et al., 2016). Furthermore, COX-2 can be downregulated by quercetin (Srivastava and Srivastava, 2019). Therefore, by targeting COX-2, quercetin might regulate immune infiltration in the CNS. It is required for the innate immune response against inflammation to be initiated by ROR-alpha (RORA), a transcription factor of nuclear receptors (García et al., 2015). RORA expression is distinctly upregulated in the AD brain (Acquaah-Mensah et al., 2015), consistent with our study the trend of RORA being present in the brain at higher levels in late stage of AD than in early stage of AD. Furthermore, we found RORA was negatively associated with AD clinical severity (MMSE 11-26) (Figure 7B). Overexpression of RORA ameliorated inflammatory damage in the mouse models (Oh et al., 2019). However, the qRT-PCR results in the present study have revealed that quercetin significantly downregulated RORA mRNA expression in AD cell model (p < 0.05) (Figure 9J), which may have a negative impact on AD pathological process via the enhancement of immune response. In many neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and Parkinson’s disease, glia dysfunction contributes to CNS pathology. Neuroinflammation generated by hyperactive glia cells is a significant feature of AD and a possible target for therapy (An et al., 2020). Gene Ontology analysis indicated glial cell differentiation is a significant biological process, where quercetin may exert pharmacological effects. In the present study, Severity-related Q-ADGs and Severity-related Q-ADG-miRNAs were divided into the part of the normal to moderate dementia group (MMSE 11–26), or severe dementia group (MMSE 0–10) was excluded, because we believe patients with severe dementia may be disturbed by other complex basic diseases, such as cerebrovascular disease, infections, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic diseases, which might exert a higher influence on gene expressions than the pathologies of AD. Otherwise, rather than the whole course of AD, the association between Q-ADG expression levels and AD severity may arise only during certain illness episodes. For example, in the early stages of AD, some genes may correlate favorably with clinical severity, but they might not correlate, or they might be negatively correlated, in the intermediate or late stages. As a result, a stratified analysis of AD patients at various phases of the illness should be conducted in the grounds of a thorough assessment of MMSE scores."

        "abstract": "The review describes correlations between impaired functioning of chaperones and co-chaperones in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The study aims to highlight significant lines of research in this field. Chaperones like Hsp90 or Hsp70 are critical agents in regulating cell homeostasis. Due to some conditions, like aging, their activity is damaged, resulting in β-amyloid and tau aggregation. This leads to the development of neurocognitive impairment. Dysregulation of co-chaperones is one of the causes of this condition. Disorders in the functioning of molecules like PP5, Cdc37, CacyBP/SIPTRAP1, CHIP protein, FKBP52, or STIP1 play a key role in AD pathogenesis. PP5, Cdc37, CacyBP/SIPTRAP1, and FKBP52 are Hsp90 co-chaperones. CHIP protein is a co-chaperone that switches Hsp70/Hsp90 complexes, and STIP1 binds to Hsp70. Recognition of precise processes allows for the invention of effective treatment methods. Potential drugs may either reduce tau levels or inhibit tau accumulation and aggregation. Some substances neuroprotect from Aβ toxicity. Further studies on chaperones and co-chaperones are required to understand the fundamental tenets of this topic more entirely and improve the prevention and treatment of AD.",

        "introduction": "It is estimated that the number of patients who have Alzheimer’s disease (AD) will be growing significantly. In the USA, currently, there are 6 million people affected by this condition, and their number is expected to increase to 13 million in 2050 . This disease, due to the gradual limitation of patients’ independence in everyday activities, generates enormous costs—unpaid guardians like closest family and friends provided 18 billion hours of guardianship valued at $339.5 billion. The Alzheimer Association estimates that 1.2 additional job positions will be needed to care for the growing AD patient population. In 2050, total payments for the care of people living with dementia are predicted to be nearly $1 trillion . This is why the pathophysiology of AD is analyzed in detail, with a concentration on events at the cell level. Scientists believe that focusing on the condition’s molecular pattern is necessary to create a successful therapy scheme. Recent discoveries point to the significant impact of the dysfunction of chosen proteins, chaperones, and co-chaperones on AD pathogenesis . Molecules like chaperones were discovered nearly 50 years ago. Their main aim is to preserve the proteasome in its correct shape under various conditions . Many studies that tried to explain its functioning have been conducted all over the years; however, there are still many questions regarding those molecules, like their specificity for client proteins or the possibility of using them in the therapy of various diseases. In this comprehensive narrative review, these correlations are investigated and described.",
        "conclusion": "A precise understanding of AD pathogenesis allows for the invention of new therapy methods. This is the hope for limiting the future expenses of healthcare for AD patients and improving the lives of people suffering from these conditions by delaying the breakthrough of the disease or reducing the severity of the symptoms. An increasing number of studies indicate that improperly functioning chaperones and co-chaperones are essential factors in the pathogenesis of AD. Proteins like Hsp90 or Hsp70 play an important role in maintaining cell homeostasis. However, disturbances in their functioning due to stress factors may result in Aβ and tau aggregation. Exclusively, heat shock protein (Hsp) chaperones are critical regulators of neurodegenerative diseases. Hsp70 and Hsp90 may prevent the early stages of amyloid aggregation . Damage to regulation by other molecules like co-chaperones, for example, PP5, Cdc37, CacyBP/SIP, the CHIP protein, and STI1/Hop, is also crucial for AD pathogenesis due to the disturbance of molecular pathways of cell homeostasis regulation. Hsp60 and Hsp70 activity may be regulated by some substances that may be used in creating possible therapy methods. Some substances may either reduce tau levels or inhibit tau accumulation and aggregation, and some may also neuroprotect from Aβ toxicity. Many aspects of the discussed issues certainly need further investigation; the present revelations allow us to make optimistic predictions for the next few years. Precise discovery of molecular impacts is undoubtedly needed to improve disturbances leading to AD."

        "title": "Sirtuins as Potential Therapeutic Targets for Mitigating Neuroinflammation Associated With Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, which is associated with memory deficit and global cognitive decline. Age is the greatest risk factor for AD and, in recent years, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that aging-related neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. The presence of β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the primary pathological hallmarks of AD; defects which can then activate a cascade of molecular inflammatory pathways in glial cells. Microglia, the resident macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS), are the major triggers of inflammation; a response which is typically intended to prevent further damage to the CNS. However, persistent microglial activation (i.e., neuroinflammation) is toxic to both neurons and glia, which then leads to neurodegeneration. Growing evidence supports a central role for sirtuins in the regulation of neuroinflammation. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases that modulate a number of cellular processes associated with inflammation. This review examines the latest findings regarding AD-associated neuroinflammation, mainly focusing on the connections among the microglial molecular pathways of inflammation. Furthermore, we highlight the biology of sirtuins, and their role in neuroinflammation. Suppression of microglial activity through modulation of the sirtuin activity has now become a key area of research, where progress in therapeutic interventions may slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "introduction": "The number of people living with different stages of dementia is growing rapidly, making it a major public health issue all over the world (Rizzi et al., 2014). In 2018, there were around 50 million people with dementia globally, and this number is projected to rise by threefold, reaching 152 million by 2050 (Patterson, 2018). Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, accounting for 60–80% of all dementia cases worldwide (Erkkinen et al., 2018; The Alzheimer’s Association, 2020). Several contributing factors have been identified, with older age considered the most important known risk factor for the development of AD (Hou et al., 2019; The Alzheimer’s Association, 2020). One in ten individuals above age 65 are reported to be suffering from AD and disease prevalence continues to rise with the increase in life expectancy (Hou et al., 2019). Interestingly, while the population over age 65 is projected to grow from 9 to 16%, the number of people over the age of 80 years is projected to triple by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). This aging-associated cognitive impairment is known to occur due to a range of structural and functional alterations in the brain of primates that occur progressively over time (Peters, 2002). These age-related brain changes include accumulation of misfolded proteins (Yankner et al., 2008; Jucker and Walker, 2013), impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Spalding et al., 2013; Ernst and Frisén, 2015; Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019), and persistent low-grade inflammation (Yankner et al., 2008; Lull and Block, 2010; Jucker and Walker, 2013). In this review, we examine the recent advances in several aspects of molecular neuropathology related to neuroinflammation and its implication to AD with special emphasis on the role of sirtuins during microglial immune response and sirtuin activators as promising neuroprotective agents for AD.",
        "conclusion": "Neuroinflammation has now being acknowledged as an important pathophysiological feature of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, every factor that is associated with neuroinflammation could be a potential target for the treatment of AD. Although early microglial activation is shown to be neuroprotective, the persistent production of proinflammatory and cytotoxic molecules by chronically activated microglia leads to neurodegeneration. Therefore, suppression of microglial activity has been considered as a potential treatment option for AD. Over the past decade an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that there is a link between sirtuins and neuroinflammation, both in the aging brain and in neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, there has been a significant progress in understanding the mechanisms by which sirtuins modulate inflammatory reactions in CNS. In this review, we have examined the latest evidence concerning the role of sirtuins in neuroinflammation, mainly focusing on NF-κB, and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in microglia. While all seven sirtuins are expressed in the mammalian brain, only a limited number of studies have been conducted to elucidate their individual roles in neuroprotection. The age-related decline of Sirt activity has recently been documented and the activation of sirtuins, particularly Sirt1, Sirt2, Sirt3, and Sirt6, has been shown to have beneficial effects on preventing AD. The course of AD pathology is significantly affected both by Sirt1 expression and by Sirt1 activity. The mitochondrial Sirt3 inhibits oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, which in return suppresses the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Hence, strategies that activate sirtuin pathways in aging microglia may offer a new therapeutic avenue for the prevention or treatment of AD. Improved understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathway activation and their effects on neuroinflammation, can guide an approach to designing better pharmacological sirtuin activators against Alzheimer’s disease."

        "title": "Extracellular vesicles as therapeutic modulators of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: a focus on signaling mechanisms.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, which contribute significantly to neuroinflammation, a central driver of disease pathogenesis. The activation of microglia and astrocytes, coupled with the complex interactions between Aβ and tau pathologies and the innate immune response, leads to a cascade of inflammatory events. This process triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, exacerbating neuronal damage and fostering a cycle of chronic inflammation that accelerates neurodegeneration. Key signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), are involved in regulating the production of these inflammatory mediators, offering potential therapeutic targets for AD. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising tool for AD therapy, due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deliver therapeutic agents. Despite challenges in standardizing EV-based therapies and ensuring their safety, EVs offer a novel approach to modulating neuroinflammation and promoting neuroregeneration. This review aims to highlight the intricate relationship between neuroinflammation, signaling pathways, and the emerging role of EV-based therapeutics in advancing AD treatment strategies.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions worldwide, placing an increasing burden due to the prolonged need for care and the lack of curative treatments. Recent research has revealed a connection between gut microbiota imbalance and AD pathogenesis , along with the potential of stem cell therapy to reduce pathology and improve cognitive function . Furthermore, studies on the impact of inflammatory processes on AD progression and the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from astrocytes in AD provide novel therapeutic avenues. These findings form a crucial foundation for developing new treatment approaches targeting AD. Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in AD pathology. Recent studies indicate a strong association between the activation of microglial cells and astrocytes and the development of AD, highlighting several potential therapeutic targets . Specifically, microglial responses to amyloid-beta (Aβ) are linked to an increased risk of AD, yet their activation can also have detrimental effects on neurons. Astrocytes, essential for brain function, can lead to neurodegeneration and synaptic retraction when impaired, leading to AD-related cognitive deficits . Furthermore, exogenous substances such as spermidine have been shown to reduce neurotoxic soluble Aβ and mitigate AD-related neuroinflammation by activating autophagy . These findings suggest that modulating the inflammatory responses of microglial cells and astrocytes is an effective strategy against AD. EVs have emerged as promising drug delivery systems for central nervous system (CNS) diseases, particularly AD, due to their biocompatibility and ability to cross biological barriers such as the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Recent research has demonstrated the significant potential of utilizing EVs for brain-targeted drug delivery. Studies have shown that combining naturally sourced EVs with drug-loaded nanoparticles, such as grapefruit EVs with doxorubicin-loaded heparin-based nanoparticles , and structurally engineered droplet drugs using fruit-derived EVs , can greatly enhance the anti-tumor effects on glioblastoma, highlighting the vast potential of EVs in brain-targeted drug delivery. Furthermore, modifications and functionalization of EVs have opened new pathways for their use as therapeutic agents for brain disorders , underscoring their promising applications in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases . Traditional AD therapies face challenges such as limited efficacy and drug delivery barriers. Nanotechnology presents an innovative approach to overcoming these challenges, particularly through systems based on EVs, which can enhance drug utilization, provide precise targeting, and reduce side effects . For instance, nano drug delivery systems have shown potential in enhancing the efficacy of NRF2 modulators in cancer treatment , and the use of nanoparticles has also presented new possibilities for AD treatment . Furthermore, the development of controlled drug release systems offers a new direction for achieving more effective drug delivery . These studies underscore the importance of optimizing drug delivery through nanotechnology, paving the way for new approaches to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. In recent years, scientists have started exploring the use of EVs as a natural nanocarrier for targeting neuroinflammation in AD. Studies indicate that EV-based therapeutic strategies can effectively modulate inflammatory response in AD, protect neurons from damage, and slow disease progression . For example, specific natural products such as 1,6-O, O-diacetylbritannilactone (OABL) have demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory activity and the ability to traverse the BBB, offering a novel approach against AD . Additionally, research has identified certain compounds like dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, showcasing a protective effect on neuronal cells . These findings highlight the potential of utilizing EVs and specific natural products as a therapeutic strategy for AD, providing crucial scientific evidence for the development of new treatment methods. While the application of EVs as nanocarriers for combating neuroinflammation in AD is still in its early stages, they are considered a promising approach for AD treatment due to their unique biocompatibility, targeting abilities, and capacity to cross the BBB. With an increasing understanding of EVs' mechanisms and advancements in bioengineering and nanotechnology, EV-based therapeutic strategies hold the potential to provide AD patients with more effective and safer treatment options . Furthermore, the development of smart EVs, capable of responding to specific signals at the disease site and offering therapeutic feedback, opens up new avenues for the next generation of nanomedicine . Despite facing challenges in commercialization, the prospects of EVs in disease treatment remain promising .",
        "conclusion": "With the advancement of research on EVs, future studies are expected to focus on the discovery of new therapeutic targets, the development of treatment strategies, and further exploration of the fundamental aspects of EVs. The identification of new therapeutic targets stands out as a crucial area for future research. This endeavor not only holds the promise of providing more precise treatment targets for neurodegenerative diseases like AD but also aids in enhancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases. By leveraging systems biology and omics technologies, researchers can pinpoint specific molecules and signaling pathways associated with diseases, laying a theoretical groundwork for the targeted delivery of therapeutics via EV drug carriers. Additionally, the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on EVs may be another key focus of future research. This includes genetically engineering EVs to enhance their targeting capabilities, payload capacities, and evasion of immune clearance, thereby improving treatment efficacy and reducing side effects. In the realm of fundamental research on EVs, future investigations aim to delve further into elucidating the mechanisms underlying the biogenesis, release, and interactions of EVs with cells. These foundational studies not only aid in uncovering the roles of EVs in physiological and pathological processes but also furnish critical scientific bases for the development of novel EV-based therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, exploring the heterogeneity and complexity of EVs may also stand out as a focal point in future endeavors. Understanding the specific functions and mechanisms of action of EVs from different sources and types holds significant importance for leveraging EVs in disease therapeutics. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the design of future EV drug delivery systems shows tremendous potential. AI and ML technologies can handle and analyze large-scale biomedical data, providing robust data support for the design and optimization of EV drug delivery systems. Through AI algorithms, the interaction between EVs and specific disease markers can be predicted, allowing for the enhancement of EVs' targeting capabilities through surface modifications. Additionally, ML methods can be utilized to analyze the distribution and metabolic dynamics of EVs in the body, thus enabling the design of more effective and safer EV drug delivery schemes. By integrating AI and ML technologies, not only can the development process of EV therapeutic strategies be accelerated, but it can also facilitate personalized medicine, offering new hope for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like AD. In conclusion, with the continuous advancement of technology and deepening research, the future application of EVs in the treatment of neurological diseases is set to become more extensive and profound. The discovery of new targets and treatment strategies, coupled with the application of AI and ML technologies, can further drive the translation of EVs from the laboratory to clinical settings, providing new directions and hope for the treatment of diseases like AD (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Extracellular vesicle therapy for Alzheimer’s disease: challenges in clinical application, technological innovation, and future opportunities (created by Biorender) In current scientific exploration, the research progress on EVs as natural nano drug carriers in combating neuroinflammation in AD demonstrates their unparalleled potential and versatility. These minuscule biological molecular complexes, with their unique biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ability to traverse the BBB, pave the way for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like AD. By loading various therapeutic molecules such as small molecule drugs, RNA, proteins, and other bioactive molecules, EVs can directly target the disease, showcasing tremendous potential in preventing and treating AD. Importantly, EV-based drug delivery systems offer a new perspective for early intervention in the disease, which holds significant importance in delaying or halting the progression of diseases like AD. Despite demonstrating significant potential in AD treatment research, translating these research findings into clinical therapeutic strategies requires overcoming a series of technical and methodological challenges related to EVs. These challenges include but are not limited to large-scale production, purification, standardization, and safety assessment of EVs. Interdisciplinary collaboration plays a crucial role in this process. Expert teams from various fields, such as biology, materials science, nanotechnology, engineering, and artificial intelligence, can accelerate the development of EV-related technologies and facilitate the discovery and optimization of new treatment strategies through cooperation. For instance, utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize the design and functionality of EVs can efficiently identify the most effective EV drug delivery systems with higher precision in a shorter timeframe. In conclusion, EVs, as natural nano drug carriers combating AD neuroinflammation, not only demonstrate enormous potential in treating complex neurological diseases but also drive the advancement of interdisciplinary research. Future efforts should focus on addressing the challenges faced in the clinical application of EVs and leveraging the advantages of interdisciplinary collaboration to expedite the translation of breakthroughs in EVs-based fundamental research into practical clinical applications. Through these collaborative efforts, we can anticipate witnessing EVs-based therapeutic strategies bringing hope and transformation to patients with AD and other neurological diseases in the near future (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Innovative applications and challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration driven extracellular vesicles in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (created by Biorender)"

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of senile dementia, includes the complex pathogenesis of abnormal deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and neuroimmune inflammatory. The neurodegenerative process of AD triggers microglial activation, and the overactivation of microglia produces a large number of neuroimmune inflammatory factors. Microglia dysfunction can lead to disturbances in iron metabolism and enhance iron-induced neuronal degeneration in AD, while elevated iron levels in brain areas affect microglia phenotype and function. In this manuscript, we firstly discuss the role of microglia in AD and then introduce the role of microglia in the immune-inflammatory pathology of AD. Their role in AD iron homeostasis is emphasized. Recent studies on microglia and ferroptosis in AD are also reviewed. It will help readers better understand the role of microglia in iron metabolism in AD, and provides a basis for better regulation of iron metabolism disorders in AD and the discovery of new potential therapeutic targets for AD.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is the most common form of dementia, presenting clinically as memory loss and cognitive decline. This disease is characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Aβ) in senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within neurons composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. These events are accompanied by neuronal and synaptic loss, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress (Lane et al., 2018; Caruso et al., 2021). The exact mechanisms that lead to these changes in AD are still inconclusive, and whether they are causative factors or consequences of the disease is debated. Among many hypotheses, immune inflammation has been suggested as an important mechanism for progressive neuronal degeneration and death in AD, in addition to the widely accepted Aβ hypothesis and the tau protein hypothesis (Walker et al., 2015; Yeh et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2020). And each hypothesis is not independent, and a growing body of evidence supports a direct relationship between abnormal Aβ production and neuroimmune inflammation and oxidative stress (Guerriero et al., 2017). Typically, AD is divided into early-onset and late-onset AD (also known as sporadic AD), the latter accounting for approximately 90% of individuals with AD (Mendez, 2017). The development of early-onset AD is related to altered genetic background (Lanoiselée et al., 2017). Although numerous risk factors are associated with the development of late-onset AD, the complete mechanism of its development remains unclear. These factors include: genetic factors such as the presence of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele, environmental factors and some lifestyle factors (Vos et al., 2017). Iron homeostasis is closely related to the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Emerging evidence suggests that iron is involved in the deposition of Aβ plaques and the formation of NTFs (Hare et al., 2013). In AD, iron is observed to be present in localized areas of neuronal death, which further supports the metal theory of dementia that iron promotes neurodegeneration (Bush, 2013). Iron, as a redox-active transition metal, plays a key role in inducing oxidative stress, which ultimately leads to neuronal cell death. This oxidative stress is thought to be exacerbated by the induction of neuroinflammation (Thomsen et al., 2015). Iron homeostasis genes [Hemochromatosis (HFE: C282Y, H63D)] are associated with a high risk of AD (Tisato et al., 2018). On the other hand, studies have shown that the C282Y and H63D HFE variants increase the risk and severity of AD under the synergistic effect of transferrin gene polymorphisms (Lehmann et al., 2012). Classic iron-responsive mRNA element (IRE) genes are sufficiently sensitive to iron overload and iron deficiency. Studies have found that iron regulatory proteins (IRPs)/IRE system interfered by iron accumulation promotes amyloid precursor protein (APP) level increase, Aβ deposition and neuron loss of AD (Yao et al., 2022). A study revealed changes in gene expression associated with the IRP/IRE system in the brain of young PSEN1 fAD mutation carriers, which is consistent with the idea that iron homeostasis disorder is an early contributor to the disease process (Hin et al., 2021). Interestingly, iron overload also leads to a new type of iron-dependent cell death-ferroptosis. Efforts have been made to understand the changes in neurons in AD in the presence of iron disorders and ferroptosis. In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia are commonly involved in supportive roles, including promoting energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and ion homeostasis. Microglia are also the resident immune cells in the brain. Microglia activation is usually triggered by neurodegenerative processes, and it is of great interest to study their role in neurological diseases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 30 genetic risk loci for AD, many of which are associated with microglial function, such as APOE and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) variants (Efthymiou and Goate, 2017; Kunkle et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2020). Inflammation in the brain is mediated by microglia and astrocytes, which generate inflammatory stimuli in response to signals (Liddelow et al., 2017). In AD, a persistent inflammatory state may lead to nerve damage followed by neuronal cell death, thereby promoting the secretion of pathological forms of tau into the extraneural milieu. In contrast, tau oligomers can reactivate microglia and cause persistent damage to neuronal cells (Morales et al., 2014; Maccioni et al., 2018). Furthermore, microglia express a variety of iron-related proteins, which are closely related to the uptake and metabolism of iron (Bishop et al., 2011; van Duijn et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018). And microglia are part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits iron uptake in healthy brains. However, in the disease state, changes in BBB permeability lead to alterations in brain iron metabolism (Rosenblum and Kosman, 2022). Excessive accumulation of iron ions will in turn affect brain iron metabolism (Brian et al., 2018). Clearly, microglia and iron metabolism are important for disease remission or progression. Therefore, we focused on the effect of microglia on iron homeostasis in the neurodegenerative disease-AD, and reviewed the interactions between microglia, iron and immune inflammation. Finally, we also reviewed the recent progress of microglia and ferroptosis research in AD. Therefore, it is convenient for readers to better understand the role of microglia in iron metabolism in AD.",
        "conclusion": "The relationship between microglia, iron and immune inflammation is undoubtedly close, and all three are either beneficial or detrimental to the disease. Data from studies on microglia in disorders of iron metabolism have certainly expanded their value in the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies of AD. Iron is a double-edged sword and the body needs to precisely regulate intracellular iron levels and achieve homeostasis between iron uptake, recycling and storage. The role of microglia in neuronal iron metabolism is heavily dependent on the factors they release including neurophilic factors, pro-inflammatory factors, and lactoferrin. On the other side, elevated iron levels in microglia-activated areas may affect their function. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the interactions between microglia, iron and immune inflammation is necessary, which may help to explore therapeutic strategies by restoring brain iron homeostasis. For example, lutein increased the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and increased the expression of MTFT in BV-2 cells (Pap et al., 2021). Aspirin significantly down-regulated the expression of TfR1 and up-regulated the expression of FPN1 and ferritin in BV-2 microglia in vitro. It indicated that aspirin negatively affects cellular iron content and partially reverses LPS-induced disruption of cellular iron homeostasis under inflammatory conditions in vitro (Xu et al., 2015). Although microglia have several important functions, they do not operate in isolation. Recently, novel roles in the interaction of astrocytes and microglia in brain homeostasis have been demonstrated. For example, astrocyte-microglia interactions via complement activation play an important role in amyloid pathology in primary glial cells, hippocampal and cortical regions of APP transgenic mice (Lian et al., 2016). Other studies have shown that M1/M2 microglia polarization regulates the communication between astrocytes and microglia. And the induction of Aβ affects microglia-astrocyte interaction by altering microglia polarization (Xie et al., 2020). However, much of the current understanding of microglia interactions with other cells is discussed through cell-specific studies involving a great deal of speculation (Damisah et al., 2020). Therefore, more experimental proof is needed. Additionally, the critical performance of microglia at the transition from protective to pathogenic and how microglia recognize the effects of these changes on cell function remain to be solved. We can speculate from the available studies that microglia may play a role in ferroptosis. However, it is intriguing to know exactly what role microglia play in the process of ferroptosis. Finally, we need to emphasize that there are considerable differences between animal models and humans with AD in iron concentration, immune-inflammatory response, and structural morphology associated with Aβ plaques. Therefore, when transferring from animal experiments to human trials and when analyzing the data, the differences between the two must be noted and considered."

        "introduction": "As the primary cause of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease for which there is no effective treatment available. Short memory loss is the early clinical symptom of AD. Other features of AD include the cognitive decline and behavioral dysfunction at a moderate level . The hallmark clinical aspect of AD is the progressive impairment of behavioral and cognitive abilities, including memory, mood, emotions, language, attention, and judgement. Nearly 60%–80%of AD patients will eventually lead to dementia . Aging is a risk factor for AD. According to the latest findings in epidemiological research, AD will become a global public health concern due to its increasing prevalence brought on by the severity of global aging. Every five years, the number of new instances of AD in adults over 60 doubles. For those over 60, the prevalence rate is 1%, and for those over 85, it is 40%. In the future, more elderly people will be diagnosed with AD due to the increasing illness risk brought on by the aging population. In 2020, there were more than 50 million people globally who have AD, up from 35 million people who received a diagnosis in 2010. According to the recent Alzheimer’s Disease International report from 2021 , 75%of dementia patients worldwide, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, remain undiagnosed due to the limitations of early diagnosis. It is anticipated by 2030, 80 million people will be diagnosed with AD, and by 2050, the number will rise to around 150 million. Furthermore, current studies indicate that one third of men and two thirds of women are at risk of developing AD in their lives. It is yet unknown why women have a higher risk of disease than men, as well as the underlying biochemical mechanisms and motivations. AD is currently estimated to cost $1 trillion globally in medical expenses, which will have a significant negative impact on society’s ability to sustain its economy. Therefore, it is critical to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of AD and investigate or pursue a viable therapy strategy in clinic.",
        "conclusion": "Therefore, by investigating the unique biomarkers of early diagnosis and advanced stage, it will elucidate the specific pathological process of AD and offer fresh suggestions for clinical treatment techniques, along with significant and valuable scientific research value."

        "introduction": "In the scenario of neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) occupies the first position of the most incident neurodegenerative disease, and in second place is Parkinson’s disease (PD), impacting 1% of the population over 60 years of age . Patients with PD usually have non-motor symptoms, including autonomic nervous system disorders such as constipation, bladder dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, impaired sleep, and smell, in addition to motor symptoms such as resting tremor, postural instability, gait disturbances, rigidity, and bradykinesia . Otherwise, at the molecular level, the abnormal accumulation of the α-synuclein protein (α-Syn) is related to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, with consequent dopamine deficiency . In this sense, the accumulation of α-Syn, the formation of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and their mutations and multiplication are linked to hereditary PD, according to Braak’s hypothesis . As a form of treatment, nucleic acid therapy for PD includes dopamine biosynthetic enzymes for increasing dopamine production or modulate basal ganglia circuitry for alleviating motor symptoms , as well as the use of factors trophies in an attempt to increase the survival of dopaminergic neurons . Thus, the spotlight is focused on the negative regulation of α-Syn gene expression, highlighting the microRNAs (miRNA) . In this way, at least five genes have been associated with this multigenic disease, including α-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), parkin, phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), as well as DJ-1 , being promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of PD . AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss, multiple cognitive impairments, and changes in personality and behavior. According to the 2018 World Alzheimer’s Report, more patients were diagnosis, and more than 50 million people are estimated to have dementia in 2018. This number is estimated to increase to 82 million by 2030 and 152 million by 2050. However, two-thirds of women and one-third of men are at risk of being diagnosed with AD at some point in their lives . The major risk for developing AD is aging. In this context, early-onset familial AD affects people younger than 65 years of age, with genetic mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes as the leading cause of familial AD early-onset . Furthermore, the ApoE 4/4 genotype significantly contributes to late-onset disease, and genetic polymorphisms in the CD2AP, EPHA1, and MS4A4/MS4A6E receptors are reported . In addition, predictors such as type 2 diabetes, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and Down Syndrome stand out. Lifestyle, diet, environment, and age can contribute to late-onset AD . In preclinical studies, anatomopathological investigations of AD from mouse brain tissues revealed that multiple findings are related to the pathogenesis of AD, such as defective miRNA regulation, mitochondrial damage, synaptic dysfunction, and amyloid formation and accumulation, as well as the formation of neuritic and neurofibrillary plaques in the brain . Based on these findings, developing innovative therapeutic strategies is imperative, highlighting cell therapy and its products, such as exosomes and miRNAs . In this approach, exosomes are extracellular vesicles that contain proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, and DNAs and play an essential role in cellular communication through biomolecules. Evidence suggests that MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-EXO) exhibit functions similar to MSCs with low immunogenicity and do not stimulate malignant transformation , and they express several cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GMCSF), and Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-1β . The exosomes and miRNA are involved in cellular communication and are documented as critical therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases . Furthermore, miRNAs function as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of these diseases and can regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of their target mRNAs . The regulation was mediated by mRNA cleavage/degradation or translation inhibition . In this sense, the altered expression of specific miRNAs in patients with AD and PD points to the important role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of these diseases and the therapeutic potential . The present study aimed to identify, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, the microRNAs related to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, establishing a guideline for developing new therapies.",
        "conclusion": "Based on the objective of the present study, it was evidenced that the majority of the twenty-five studies of AD and PD presented a mean accuracy in identifying miRNAs by qPCR above 84%, with moderate to strong scientific evidence. These showed greater scientific credibility in the findings of each study, contributing in a tangible way to identifying the main miRNAs as selective biomarkers for the diagnosis of these diseases, as well as therapeutic targets in gene, cellular, and pharmacological treatment. The present study’s results do not show a risk of bias, both in studies with large and small sample sizes. In addition, two studies (Burgos et al., 2014 and Nie et al., 2020 ) presented the results of the quantification of miRNAs for both AD and PD. The total up-regulated and down-regulated miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets were obtained mainly from CSF, serum, and plasma. Most miRNAs were obtained from serum and plasma, facilitating laboratories worldwide’ work for rapid sampling identification and quantification sampling. The published studies selected in the present analysis presented mainly two types of controls, one composed of healthy participants and the other composed of participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), frontotemporal lobar degeneration, DLB (dementia with Lewy bodies), multiple system atrophy, and Progressive Supranuclear palsy. In addition, studies that presented Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases with genetic causes and not by transient or epigenetic effects were selected to eliminate the main confounders in accurately identifying miRNAs for AD and PD. Furthermore, in the studies with better accuracy rates in the identification by qPCR of AD and PD miRNAs, the distribution of the values of the means and standard deviation of the accuracy (%) of each study concerning the values of the total mean of AD and PD was, respectively, 84.37 ± 7.94% and 84.32 ± 7.15%. Among these, eight studies were identified with accuracy values (%) equal to or above the total average for AD, and seven studies were identified for PD in the identification and quantification of miRNAs (up- and downregulated) of greater scientific credibility as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the identification of these diseases. Additionally, from the total number of miRNAs identified (90 AD and 54 PD) which have the highest chances (Odds Ratio) of being identified by qPCR, a regression analysis was performed, which indicated five (5) miRNAs—miR-26b-5p (up-regulated), miR-615-3p (up-regulated), miR-4722-5p (up-regulated), miR23a-3p (up-regulated), and miR-27b-3p for AD, with OR = 2.55 (1023–3432) and p = 0.004 < 0.05, and only one (1) miRNA related to PD, miR-374a-5p (down-regulated), with OR = 2.16 (0.087–3.567) and p = 0.0035 < 0.05. After crossing the information, the results showed that all miRNAs (AD and PD) that presented the highest chances of being identified by qPCR (Table 9) are included in the groups of the prominent miRNAs with high accuracy (%), except for miR-27b-3p, belonging to the AD group of Table 9, as shown in Figure 4 of this study. These findings strongly highlighted the main miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD and PD, thus contributing to future studies of advanced therapy with anti-miRNAs or antigenic modulation through vectors such as mesenchymal stem cell exosomes , as well as for pharmacological therapies . In this context, exosomes present a potential mechanism for the modulation of pathological α-Syn in the brain, as they can transport proteins and genetic material between cells, including mRNA and miRNA, contributing to the relief of AD and PD symptoms. Furthermore, because of their small size, exosomes can be used as vectors for the delivery of therapeutics . Considering the critical role of α-Syn in PD, it is clear to understand the mechanisms that regulate its expression for therapeutic purposes since the reduced expression of these specific miRNAs can result in high levels of α-Syn in patients with PD. As a corollary of this, miR-7 and miR-153 have been shown to accelerate the degradation of performed α-Syn fibrils . Additionally, MiR-205 levels are reduced in the frontal and striate cortex of PD patients, and LRRK2 expression is increased . Genome-wide association studies have also identified variations in miR-4519 and miR-548at-5p related to PD . However, the present study did not recruit this miRNA because it did not present significant accuracy in serum or plasma, given that the purpose of this study was to elect the main miRNAs of rapid and high identification and quantification for the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases and indications of biological and pharmacological direct relevance. Based on these findings, it is essential to better understand the common genetic variants associated with AD and PD since most of the genetic risk remains uncharacterized. It is imperative to understand the role of regulatory elements such as miRNAs. The miRNAs relevant to neurodegenerative diseases are related to axonal guidance, apoptosis, and inflammation, so AD and PD likely arise from defects in underlying biological pathways. Furthermore, pathways regulated by APP, L1CAM, and genes from the caspase family may represent promising therapeutic targets of miRNAs in AD and PD, being therapeutic targets of deregulated miRNAs in both disorders . As a corollary, targeting miRNAs offers a potential therapeutic opportunity for AD and PD, highlighting two strategies. The aim of this approach is based on the hypothesis that the downregulation of the specific protein level is a protective therapeutic strategy . In this sense, the miRNA mimics that are used to inhibit the expression of target proteins stand out. Moreover, miRNA-based therapy involves using anti-miRNA molecules to cause the loss of specific miRNA function . As an example, miRNA-7 targets the 3′-UTR of α-Syn mRNA and facilitates the clearance of α-synuclein aggregates , and it exhibits protective effects against MPP+/1-methyl-4-induced toxicity -phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) . Therefore, miRNAs circulating in the blood and other biofluids can be characterized and used as non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers that facilitate early disease detection and the continuous monitoring of AD and PD disease progression. Such screening is essential for understanding which types of miRNAs change in the progression of these diseases and when these changes happen . In this way, the results of the present study can act as a guideline for miRNAs for research laboratories and pharmaceutical industries of interest in the possible treatments of AD and PD diseases. Soon, these results may support the diagnosis of these diseases and offer therapeutic interventions earlier in the disease process. Based on the findings of this study, it was evident that most Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases studies showed accuracy in the qPCR identification of miRNAs above the total average, demonstrating greater scientific credibility and solidly contributing to the identification of the main microRNAs as selective biomarkers for the diagnosis of these diseases, as well as therapeutic targets. The major signatures were miR-26b-5p, miR-615-3p, miR-4722-5p, miR23a-3p, and miR-27b-3p for AD and miR-374a-5p for PD. There were six miRNAs of intersection between AD and PD: miR-197-3p, Mir-576-5p, miR-1468-5p, miR-375, miR-let-7e-5p, and miR-122-3p. This article can act as a microRNA guideline for research laboratories and pharmaceutical industries for treating Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases and offer the opportunity to evaluate therapeutic interventions earlier in the disease process."

Therefore it is crucial to explore novel and effective therapeutic targets. The gut microbiota - brain axis has been found to play a role in Alzheimer's disease by regulating the neuro-immune and endocrine systems. At the same time, acupuncture can modulate the gut microbiota and may impact the course of Alzheimer's disease.

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. As populations continue to age worldwide, AD has rapidly become one of the most costly diseases to health systems and carries very high emotional burden to families and caregivers (Scheltens et al., 2021). About 47 million people worldwide are currently estimated to suffer from dementia, a figure that is expected to triple by 2050 (Arvanitakis et al., 2019; Ashrafian et al., 2021). AD is a neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (Ferrari and Sorbi, 2021). The primary clinical manifestation of AD is a decline in cognitive-behavioral abilities, leading to loss of independence in life; however, there is no accepted view of the underlying pathology (Armstrong, 2019). AD is considered a multifactorial disease, with risk factors that include age, genetic factors, head injury, infections, environmental factors (such as heavy metals and exposure to other polluters), and psychological disorders (Heneka et al., 2015; Scheltens et al., 2021). Epidemiological data shows that the onset of AD is most common in people older than 65 years, suggesting that age is the strongest risk factor for developing AD (Guerreiro and Bras, 2015; Khanahmadi et al., 2015). The presence of Aβ plaques, which are thought to be critical to the development of AD, in different areas of the brain triggers synaptic deficits and neurodegeneration by activating autoimmune responses, ultimately leading to cognitive impairment (Khan et al., 2020). NFT is an abnormal filament of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that twists around each other to form paired helices (Brion, 1998), causing loss of function of the tau protein and negatively affecting axonal function (Utton et al., 2005), leading to Aβ accumulation and neurodegeneration. Central neuroinflammation is characterized by activation astrocytes and microglia, with the pro-inflammatory effect of M1 microglia playing a particularly important role (Habib et al., 2020; Merighi et al., 2022). Indeed, microglia are now one of the emerging therapeutic targets for AD (Mo et al., 2021). Research in recent years has revealed a correlation between gut microbiota and the development of AD. This is currently one of the critical research areas in the field and a promising therapeutic target (Kim et al., 2020). Some evidence has demonstrated that gut microbiota is associated with the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative lesions (Kowalski and Mulak, 2019; Megur et al., 2020; Doifode et al., 2021). However, the specific mechanism of action underlying this association is unclear. Acupuncture is a traditional therapy in Chinese medicine with a long history of improving dementia (Yan et al., 2022). Acupuncture has been shown to improve cognition in patients with AD as well as improving their ability to live independently with effects that are similar to those obtained with drugs (Huang J. et al., 2020; Wang L. Y. et al., 2020; Wang Y. Y. et al., 2020). Studies have also shown that acupuncture reduces Aβ deposition, improves cholinergic neurotransmission, and stimulates activation of cognitively relevant brain regions to ameliorate AD (Cai et al., 2019; Tu et al., 2019; Wang Y. et al., 2020). This paper reviews recent evidence on the role of acupuncture to modulate gut microbiota as a therapy for AD. We discuss the effects of acupuncture and the gut microbiota on neuromodulatory mechanisms and immune regulation in AD, and suggest that acupuncture combined with modulation of the gut microbiota may be beneficial in the treatment of AD in the future. Figure 1 shows the relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and the gut microbiota.",
        "conclusion": "The gut microbiota, the largest bacterial reservoir in the body, interacts and affects the function of various organs and systems in the body. The rapid increase of incidence and prevalence of AD represents a significant public health concern for society today. The factors involved in the development of AD are diverse and difficult to pinpoint, especially in the context of an increasingly complex society. The gut microbiota has emerged as a potential target for AD, via maintenance of gut homeostasis, activation of the immune response, modulation of inflammatory responses, and regulation of the nervous system. In this Review, we present evidence of the relationship between the gut microbiota and AD, particularly with regards to the role of acupuncture in modulating gut microbiota and discuss current challenges. There is promising evidence that the gut microbiota impacts AD, as its structure and composition have been proven to have a functional impact on AD patients. In this context, probiotic supplementation has emerged as a potential treatment for AD. However, this therapy is not clinical evidence-based and needs to be further investigated and confirmed in a large sample in a clinical setting or a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Acupuncture has been shown to modulate the gut microbiota. We summarized the acupoints mentioned in each study in this review (Table 6). At present, in the research related to intestinal microbiota and AD, the three meridians of ST, GV and BL are the main ones, and ST36 and GV20 are the most common acupoints combinations. However, based on our assessment of the literature, there is a lack of consistency in the choice of acupuncture points across the various studies. As the choice of the acupuncture point is the most important factor in determining the effects of acupuncture, its standardization will be essential in future research. It is also important to mention that quantification of the effect on the gut microbiota induced by the different acupuncture techniques and modalities (e.g., traditional acupuncture, warm acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, electroacupuncture) should be also standardized. Many of the studies cited in this review used electroacupuncture (EA), which is a combination of acupuncture and conventional electrotherapy. Some studies have shown no significant difference in efficacy between EA and conventional acupuncture (Amorim et al., 2022). Similarly, studies have suggested that the efficacy of EA is related to specific parameters. For example, 100 Hz EA or high-frequency acupuncture has the best analgesic effect (Zhang et al., 2023). Therefore, the future research on the role of acupuncture in AD may require the development of a comprehensive operational framework to systematically investigate its effect on the intestinal microbiota. In addition, there is scarce research on the role of specific acupuncture points on changes of microbiota and on the role of probiotics and therefore further investigations are needed. The blood–brain barrier, an essential component of the neurovascular unit, is essential to maintain brain homeostasis. Based on evidence from the literature, acupuncture appears to repair a damaged blood–brain barrier. However, the exact mechanism underlying this effect is unknown and the number of studies on this topic is insufficient to draw robust conclusions. Similarly, no evidence exists to allow conclusions on whether acupuncture can prevent or repair the natural breakdown of the blood–brain barrier, which is particularly important in aging and AD. As the blood–brain barrier allows exchange of substances within and outside the brain, it can also transport harmful substances and nutrients into the brain as a result of an inflammatory response. Acupuncture can increase the permeability of the blood–brain barrier and reduce the central inflammatory response. However, as noted above, further research on research is needed. We reviewed the recent evidence related to acupuncture and modulation of the gut microbiota in AD. We mainly included studies published in past 5 years, which reports promising results. However, there are inevitable limitations. There was high heterogeneity in the animal studies included due to differences in intervention protocols, intervention targets, feeding methods, and outcome measures. There were differences in the studies with regards to the type of acupuncture intervention, techniques, choice of acupuncture points, effects (i.e., sensations such as acid, numbness, swelling, pain, etc.) and outcomes. We summarised the characteristics of studies included in this review in Supplementary Tables S1, S2. In conclusion, targeting the gut microbiota offers promising potential therapeutic targets for AD, but further research is needed before these findings can have clinical impact in patients with AD."

In addition, according to the current clinical application status of natural drugs, this paper analysis the delivery route and delivery mode of ginsenosides from the perspective of pharmacokinetics, providing a deeper insight into the clinical application of ginsenosides in the treatment of AD.",
        "year": "2022",
        "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36467099/",
        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease, namely the gradual loss of neuronal structure and function in the brain, characterized by memory loss, cognitive and functional deficits, and behavioral disorders. At present, no effective clinical drugs have been found to prevent the progression of the disease. Though the pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood, its major pathological features have been identified: extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) formation and aggregates of the phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein Tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (Lane et al., 2018) (Figure 1). More and more evidence suggests that Aβ and tau proteins begin to accumulate years before clinical symptoms appear (Bejanin et al., 2017). According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, it is the main influencing factor that the accumulation of Aβ in the brain drives the pathogenesis of AD. Continuous aggregation and deposition of Aβ peptides induce inflammation and microglial cascades, broad-spectrum ion and neurotransmitter abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, etc. The imbalance of Aβ production and clearance leads to the hyperphosphorylation of tau to NFTs, which further leads to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and destruction, ultimately leading to extensive cortical dysfunction (Atri, 2019). In addition to the Aβ hypothesis, the cholinergic hypothesis has a place in the development of potential therapies for AD. The hypothesis suggests that cholinergic deficits are thought to be responsible for the cognitive, behavioral, and overall functional characteristics of AD. At present, the treatment of neurological diseases is mainly drug and surgical treatment. Current treatment methods mainly use acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, such as Donepezil, Rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate, Galanthamine, etc. (Lane et al., 2018), to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission by preventing the hydrolysis of acetylcholine and subsequently increasing its synaptic level. However, the effect is not significant, and long-term use of drugs can lead to drug accumulation and poisoning, resulting in certain side effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal reactions (Vaz and Silvestre, 2020). It is worth noting that these drugs can only improve some of the main symptoms of AD, but do not delay or reverse the onset of AD. On the other hand, surgical treatment often increases the chance of infection and other dysfunction. For the past few years, researchers have increasingly focused their attention on bioactive chemicals in natural medicine for new inspiration and the development of new therapeutic drugs. Ginseng is a kind of popular natural Chinese herbal medicine, including Korean Red Ginseng (KRG), Panax quinquefolius, etc. It is widely used in China, Japan and Korea due to its multiple pharmacological activities and low toxicity and side effect. Its clinical application is extensive, with anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and vasodilation regulation effects, with great development and utilization value (Dai et al., 2017). In recent years, many molecular targets of ginseng have been identified. Ginsenosides, the first active ingredient isolated from ginseng, can be extracted from root, stem, leaf and fruit, and are mostly distributed in the outer cortex and tubing of the root (Christensen, 2008; Xu et al., 2017). About 30 ginsenosides have been identified from ginseng using existing isolation techniques and processing methods. Ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 are the most abundant ginsenosides in ginseng root. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the content of ginsenoside Rg1 in dried ginseng root was 0.22 ± 0.02% (Xie et al., 2018). Especially, steamed Panax ginseng is the only marketed ginseng known to contain ginsenoside Rg3 (Jovanovski et al., 2014). In terms of structure, ginsenosides all contain the same tetracyclic hydrophobic steroid structure with different sugar components attached. In terms of chemistry, according to the number and position of sugar components, ginsenosides can be divided into protopanaxadiol (PPD) groups, protopanaxatriol (PPT) groups and oleanolic acid groups (Cho, 2012), structure of different ginsenosides types is shown in Figure 2. At present, the identification of ginsenosides structure mainly adopts UV, IR, NMR, and MS modern structure identification techniques combined with physical and chemical properties and elemental analysis methods. Differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and other supporting methods can be used to further confirm the structure of ginsenosides. Factors such as substituents, number and configuration of sugar all affect the neuroprotective mechanism of ginsenosides in the AD process (Figure 3). Among them, ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, and Rg1 account for more than 90% of the total ginsenosides of ginseng, and are the most studied at present (Mohanan et al., 2018). Recently, it has been demonstrated that kinds of ginsenosides have beneficial effects in both in vitro and in vivo models of AD (Table 1). Ginsenosides have different neuropharmacological effects. In addition to inhibiting the formation of Aβ and Tau hyperphosphorylation to form NFTs to delay the process of AD, ginsenosides also exert neuroprotective effects through different mechanisms, including inhibiting oxidative stress, regulating neuroinflammation, improving mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing toxin-induced apoptosis (Kim et al., 2018). For example, ginsenoside Rg1, one of the most widely studied active ingredients in ginseng, has been proved to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in a large number of in vivo and in vitro experiments, and can relieve nerve damage and cognitive dysfunction in the process of AD (Long et al., 2014).",
        "conclusion": "From the perspective of the current study on the pathogenesis of AD, its pathogenic factors are very complex, which brings some difficulties to the research and development of AD treatment drugs but also brings opportunities for the study of the role of natural drugs in AD. The failure of many clinical trials suggests that treating AD with a single target is difficult, while multi-target drugs and cocktail combination drugs may be an important direction of AD drug development in the future. China has unique advantages in the research of natural products, many of which have multi-target pharmacological activity. As a famous natural Chinese herbal medicine, ginseng, its active ingredient (especially ginsenosides), has shown good neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms without side effects and has been proved to be beneficial to the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases for many years. In this review, we systematically and comprehensively summarize recent studies on the effects of ginsenosides on cognitive and memory dysfunction in AD patients or animal models, demonstrating that ginseng can block or improve the pathological process at different stages of AD by regulating a variety of signaling molecules and pathways, including inhibition of Aβ production and accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, inhibition of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, from the perspective of pharmacokinetics, it is a new strategy that changes the delivery mode or develops new drug delivery vectors to improve the clinical application value of ginsenosides. Overall, this review provides a deeper insight into the understanding of the application of ginsenosides and its further development may create a new situation for the treatment of AD."

        "abstract": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is characterized by the uncoupling of bone resorption and bone formation induced by estrogen deficiency, which is a complex outcome related to estrogen and the immune system. The interaction between bone and immune cells is regarded as the context of PMOP. Macrophages act differently on bone cells, depending on their polarization profile and secreted paracrine factors, which may have implications for the development of PMOP. PMOP, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) might have pathophysiological links, and the similarity of their pathological mechanisms is partially visible in altered macrophages and cytokines in the immune system. This review focuses on exploring the pathological mechanisms of PMOP, RA, and AD through the roles of altered macrophages and cytokines secretion. First, the multiple effects on cytokines secretion by bone-bone marrow (BM) macrophages in the pathological mechanism of PMOP are reviewed. Then, based on the thought of \"different tissue-same cell type-common pathological molecules-disease pathological links-drug targets\" and the methodologies of \"molecular network\" in bioinformatics, highlight that multiple cytokines overlap in the pathological molecules associated with PMOP vs. RA and PMOP vs. AD, and propose that these overlaps may lead to a pathological synergy in PMOP, RA, and AD.

Bone and immune system are functionally linked by complex molecular networks, in which accumulating evidence suggests that macrophages either directly or indirectly through the secretion of various cytokines, coordinate the coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts (6, 7). The relationship among estrogen, macrophages, and the skeleton could help in understanding the complex mechanism of PMOP. The complex crosstalk between bone and immune cells plays an indispensable role in the pathogenesis of PMOP. Immunomodulatory imbalances and functional alterations are also part of the pathological conditions of PMOP, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Immunological studies have demonstrated that different tissue-resident cells of the macrophage lineage, such as bone-bone marrow (BM) macrophages, synovial macrophages, and microglia, are responsible for pathological changes in PMOP, RA, and AD, respectively. The existence of pathological links in PMOP, RA, and AD may be explained by searching for the common molecular network mediated by bone-BM macrophages, synovial macrophages, and microglia to provide a novel strategy for potential drug targets for the treatment of PMOP.",
        "conclusion": "PMOP is caused by dysregulation of the homeostatic connection between bone and the immune system, leading to bone loss. This review has outlined the direct and indirect effects of cytokines secreted by bone-BM macrophages on the coupling of bone resorption and bone formation. The principal mechanisms of these effects include inflammatory/immune responses, angiogenesis, and oxidative stress. Some overlapping cytokines of PMOP, RA, and AD in bioinformatics analysis may immunologically link two diseases, serving as either shared susceptibility factors or molecular links. Therefore, based on the thought of “different tissue (bone-BM, synovial, and brain)-same cell type (macrophages)-common pathological molecules (cytokines)-disease pathological links (PMOP vs. RA and PMOP vs. AD)-drug targets (active compounds extracted from Chinese herbs)” and the methodologies of “molecular network” in bioinformatics, may lead to a paradigm shift in the understanding of the pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatment of PMOP."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia globally; however, the aetiology of AD remains elusive hindering the development of effective therapeutics. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of gene expression and have been of growing interest in recent studies in many pathologies including AD not only for their use as biomarkers but also for their implications in the therapeutic field. In this study, miRNA and protein profiles were obtained from brain tissues of different stage (Braak III-IV and Braak V-VI) of AD patients and compared to matched controls. The aim of the study was to identify in the late stage of AD, the key dysregulated pathways that may contribute to pathogenesis and then to evaluate whether any of these pathways could be detected in the early phase of AD, opening new opportunity for early treatment that could stop or delay the pathology. Six common pathways were found regulated by miRNAs and proteins in the late stage of AD, with one of them (Rap1 signalling) activated since the early phase. MiRNAs and proteins were also compared to explore an inverse trend of expression which could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets. These results suggest that specific miRNA changes could represent molecular fingerprint of neurodegenerative processes and potential therapeutic targets for early intervention.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia, leading to severe disability and early death, and with devastating consequences for families, health-care systems, and society . It affects approximately between 40 and 50 million globally, but the number of cases is expected to triple by 2050 owing to population growth and ageing . Most AD cases are considered sporadic, and the cause is unclear; however, a notable risk factor is carrying the APOE4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene . Fewer than 1% of AD cases are known to be familial, caused by inheritance of rare autosomal dominant mutations of amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), where PSEN1 and PSEN2 are involved in the processing of APP to amyloid-beta (Aβ) . Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is based on a history of cognitive decline combined with neurological and laboratory analysis, including the measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Aβ and tau tangles and neuroimaging scans to identify brain atrophy and anatomical changes . The histological hallmarks of AD pathology are Aβ-plaques and tau tangles accompanied by neuron loss in the brain. The pathology follows a specific pattern of brain regions in which plaques and tangles are found and mapped according to Braak staging . Although the FDA recently approved the first Alzheimer’s medication clearing out amyloid plaques, this intervention is still controversial, and to date, no treatment has shown a clear/undoubted patient clinical benefit. This may be a consequence of the late-stage diagnosis of patients as well as the fact that the numerous studied compounds are unable to modify the disease process . Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover early mechanistic biomarkers/endpoints as well as new therapeutic targets. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), a small non-coding RNA class of post-transcriptional regulators, are particularly attractive molecules due to their ability to regulate multiple genes. Technology has now been developed to isolate, quantify, and profile miRNAs in diseases and is being combined with approaches to deliver miRNA therapeutics effectively without an immunogenic response . Whilst these developments are promising, there are currently no miRNA therapeutics available; however, there is a remarkable effort in place, with many entering clinical trials with the earliest implication for cancer . Consequently, miRNA as a therapy presents a promising solution for multifactorial diseases, such as AD, which do not yet have successful disease-modifying treatments; however, further research is required to elucidate the potential role of miRNA in this complex pathology. Previous studies in AD patients have highlighted changes in the expression of miRNAs that target AD-related mRNA and proteins. Among them, miR-101 and miR-16 have been shown to target APP mRNA . MiR-124 was downregulated in the AD model SAMP8 mice, leading to enhanced expression of the splicing regulator PTBP1 and aberrant APP splicing . Several miRNAs are involved in the amyloid cascade through the regulation of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), including miR-107, miR-29a/b-1, miR-29c, miR-188-3p, miR-339-5p, miR-195, miR-186, and miR-124 in animal and human studies . Other miRNAs that target the catalytic subunits of γ-secretase have also been shown to be deregulated in AD. Furthermore, Tau protein, the main constituent of neurofibrillary tangles, has been shown to be regulated by miR-132 and miR-34a . In this study, we present an integrated analysis of miRNA and protein expression from the brains of AD patients. The primary outcome was to elucidate the pathological mechanism that can lead to neuronal death in confirmed and late AD cases. This was reached through the expression analyses of miRNAs and proteins and their related pathways in controls and AD (Braak V-VI stage) patients. The secondary outcome had the aim to investigate whether any of these pathological mechanisms or pathways detected in the late stage of AD were also present at the early stage of AD (Braak III-IV) and consequently whether any of the molecules differentially expressed can be used as early indicators of the pathology or as potential targets to stop or delay the progress of the pathology.",
        "conclusion": "Alzheimer’s disease is a complex, multifactorial disease with no available treatment due to the lack of understanding of causative factors of the disease. It is also difficult to diagnose AD early in the disease process because of the late onset nature of symptoms and the lack of clinical clarity between AD and other neurodegenerative and neurocognitive diseases. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the initiation of neurodegeneration is critical, and the early stages of disease may present a valuable therapeutic window before irreversible brain damage has occurred. Therefore, in this paper, we had two main objectives; the first one was to identify the molecular mechanisms and the cellular processes developed in the late and confirmed cases of AD. We achieved this outcome profiling microRNAs and proteins in the brains of AD Braak V-VI patients. The microRNAs and proteins found significantly and differentially expressed were then used for advanced bioinformatic analyses to determine their relative pathways. In addition, an inverse relation between miRs and protein targets was also investigated. The inverse association with protein targets has a greater likelihood of directly targeting those proteins, making them suitable for miRNA therapy. The second objective was to perform the same analyses as above using brain tissue of AD patients at an early stage (Braak III-IV) and comparing them to controls. This second outcome was to evaluate if any of the mechanisms detected in the late phase of AD could be earlier identified, therefore opening a window for potential early interventions. MiRNAs were a phenomenon discovered in 1993, and ever since, there has been much interest in their ability to regulate gene expression within diseases . More recently, they have been studied as biomarker candidates of many pathologies, including AD, in blood and CSF . A comparison between blood/CSF miRNAs and brain DE-miRNAs of this research is available in (Supplementary Materials Table S3). Results matched 14 DE-miRNAs between biofluids and brain tissue, offering an alternative way of non-invasively monitoring any change or advancement of AD pathology. In this study, we identified 14 DE-miRNAs and 73 DE-proteins between the control and early stage of AD samples. An inverse expression was seen in the upregulation of miR-204-5p and its potential downregulated target SELE (selection E), a protein responsible for accumulation of leukocytes at the sites of inflammation. MiR-204 was also depicted by our analysis using pathway studio as key regulator of senescence (Figure 5, panel B). Other studies showed miR-204-5p to be one of the most abundantly expressed in AD and upregulated in sporadic Parkinson’s disease patients, leading to apoptosis of dopaminergic cells in the brain . However, none was able to prove that SELE was a miR-204-5p target. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 58 mutual KEGG pathways between Braak III-IV DE-miRNAs and DE-proteins and one common pathway, the R1 signalling pathway. Rap1 is a small GTPase that controls diverse processes, such as cell adhesion, cell-cell junction formation, and cell polarity, by regulating the function of integrins and other adhesion molecules . Previous studies showed that inhibition of Rap1 interactions reduces Ca2+ dysfunction and improves neuronal survival . Cell adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation are two pathways found regulated by DE-proteins of early AD using pathway studio. The same pathways were also found in DE-miRNAs and DE-proteins of the late stage of AD. In the late stage of AD, we reported 44 DE-miRNAs compared to control, of which four were in common with the early stage of AD, and 119 DE-proteins, of which 18 were in common with the early stage. By identifying miRNAs and target proteins with an inverse expression, we were also able to select 34 potential connections that may play a role in AD pathology (Table 4). The associated KEGG pathways also helped to understand the possible cellular effects of each deregulated miRNA. Forty-two pathways were found in proteins and 69 in microRNAs and six pathways were in common: ECM-receptor interaction, MAPK signalling pathway, Ras signalling pathway, PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, FoxO signalling pathway, and Rap1 signalling pathway. The first pathway, the ECM-receptor interaction, also confirmed by the pathway studio analysis of DE-proteins, is related to cellular integrity and consists of proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycans (PGs/GAGs), proteins, proteinases, and cytokines, which surround cells and facilitate intercellular communication . In CNS, fibrous proteins (collagen, elastin) and adhesive glycoproteins (laminin, fibronectin) were responsible for the strength and elasticity of the ECM . ECM also regulates intercellular communication and coordinate processes, such as cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis as well as tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis , and aberrant expression of the ECM components in the brain can lead to neuro-development disorders, psychiatric dysregulation, and neuro-degenerative diseases . An upregulation of collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin in the brains of AD and a co-localization with Senile Plaques was also proven . In our study, we found several inverse expressions between miRs and proteins with a function in the ECM pathway. Among them, we found hsa-miR-671-5p and Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), an adhesive glycoprotein that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. This protein can bind to fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin, type V collagen, and integrins alpha-V/beta-1, hsa-miR-132-3p, and hsa-miR-212-3p, inversely related to CD44, which was previously found upregulated in severe Alzheimer’s disease . hsa-miR-30e-5p and Integrin beta-1 (ITGB1), a receptor for collagen, is another interaction, and it was suggested to undergo plasticity through interactions with ECM proteins, modulating ion channels, intracellular Ca2+ and protein kinases signalling, and reorganization of cytoskeletal filaments . ECM and integrin aberrations are likely to contribute to imbalanced synaptic function in epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, mental deficiency, schizophrenia, and other brain conditions . hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-425-3p, and hsa-miR-1237-3p are all downregulated, and all show the upregulated fibronectin (FN1) as potential target. Fibronectin is the adhesive protein that connects cells with collagen fibres in the ECM, binds to cell-surface integrin regulating cytoskeleton reorganization, and facilitates cell migration . In addition, several studies reported that the upregulation of fibronectin enhanced the adherence of microglial cells and lead to APP secretion and Aβ aggregation in AD pathogenesis. The other five pathways found to be compromised in the late stage of AD are MAPK, FoxO, Rap1, Ras, and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways. These are intracellular signalling pathways and are required for signal relay, signal amplification, and integration of stimuli in the cell, leading to proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation. The MAPK signalling pathway is key for signal transduction between neurons and is involved in the maintenance of synaptic plasticity, which is reduced with progression of AD . In particular, p38 MAPK is stimulated by phosphorylated tau, normal dephosphorylated tau, and Aβ oligomers, leading to inflammatory signalling and activation of microglia in AD and inhibition of p38 MAPK pathways, successfully reducing Aβ and memory loss in AD mice and suggesting this MAPK signalling as an important therapeutic target. FoxO signalling pathway is active in many parts of the brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. It functions to determine cell fate and survival, leading to apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Dysregulation of FoxOs can lead to increased apoptosis and oxidative stress . Some studies also suggest that FoxO proteins may be a downstream target of APP, leading to an APP intracellular domain induced death in neurones, with APP as a transcriptional coactivator of FoxO proteins . Other studies speculated that FoxO proteins may also be upstream regulators of APP . The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway seems to be particularly important for mediating neuronal survival , playing a role in learning and memory as well . It is also involved in the pathogenesis of acute cerebrovascular disease, neurodegeneration diseases, epilepsies, and AD . The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was one of the inverse expressed targets in this pathway, and several studies demonstrated that EGFR inhibitors improve pathological and behavioural conditions in AD . Moreover, EGFR expression is up-regulated in reactive astrocytes, and its hyper-activation leads to astrogliosis . The neuroprotective effect of EGFR inhibition was demonstrated in ALS also . EGFR is regulated by miR-1-3p, and this interaction was already found in cancer . Finally, research groups also reported an increased Ras expression in cells with upregulated APP expression, which could lead to deregulation of the cell cycle . In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miRNAs and proteins are differentially expressed in the early and late stages of Alzheimer’s disease. The correlation between their expression must be explored further to understand how these miRNAs regulate gene expression in disease progression. In addition, mutual signalling pathways between the differential miRNAs and proteins were investigated, showing only one common pathway (the Rap1 signalling) between the early and late stage of AD. While the differentially expressed miRNAs and mutual signalling pathways that were found in this study are in line with previous work, new interactions between miRNA and protein targets were also identified. These novel findings must be investigated further to gain a deeper understanding of their roles in AD and their potential use as therapeutic targets. The results of this can be taken as a basis for future, larger-scale studies."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease whose prevalence increases with age. An increasing number of findings suggest that abnormalities in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a single transmembrane aspartic protein that is cleaved by β- and γ-secretases to produce β-amyloid protein (Aβ), are a major pathological feature of AD. In recent years, a large number of studies have been conducted on the APP processing pathways and the role of secretion. This paper provides a summary of the involvement of secretases in the processing of APP and the potential drug targets that could provide new directions for AD therapy.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, with approximately 60% of clinical cases of dementia being AD . The main risk factor for AD is age, with the incidence doubling every five years after age 65. In addition, a small number of AD cases are inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner, and carriers may develop this disease after approximately 40 years of age. Clinically, AD is mainly characterized by progressive memory impairment, cognitive dysfunction and language impairment . There are many hypotheses about the pathogenesis of AD, and the most widely accepted is the amyloid cascade hypothesis . Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is proteolyzed by β-secretase and γ-secretase to produce the β-amyloid (Aβ) protein. When the normal expression and processing of APP are affected, the balance between Aβ production and clearance gradually changes. The accumulation of Aβ triggers a series of cascade reactions, including tau protein phosphorylation, neurotransmitter loss, and neuroinflammatory reactions, eventually leading to neuronal dysfunction, death, inflammatory plaque formation, neurofibrillary tangle formation and other pathological phenomena. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of AD are not well understood, the polymerization and deposition of Aβ, which is produced by abnormal metabolism of APP, is considered to be an important cause of AD . α-, β- and γ-Secretases play a crucial role in the metabolism of APP. AD is classified by the age of onset. If the age of onset is less than 65 years old, the disease is classified as familial AD (FAD), and if the age of onset is more than 65 years old, the disease is regarded as sporadic AD. FAD accounts for less than 5% of the total number of AD cases and is mainly closely related to mutations in genes such as APP , presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2). PS1 mutations, most of which are loss-of-function mutations that lead to decreased PS1 activity, are the main cause of FAD . APP mutations change the processing of APP, leading to the production of neurotoxic Aβ42 and reduction in Aβ40. By triggering a variety of pathological mechanisms, Aβ42 selectively promotes the apoptosis or death of some nerve cells, which ultimately leads to the occurrence of AD. The PS proteins, encoded by the PS1 and PS2 genes, are an important part of gamma-secretase. Mutations in the PS1 gene result in the deletion of the hydrophilic loop domain of the encoded protein, which leads to a change in its conformation, which in turn affects the activity of γ-secretase and increases the production of Aβ42. In large cohort studies, most PS1 mutations were found to be missense mutations (Val97Leu and Ala136Gly), and a Val97Leu transgenic mouse model was established, in which the pathogenicity of this mutation was initially confirmed. Therefore, studying the pathogenesis of PS1 mutations in FAD is helpful for the understanding of the etiology of FAD and, at the same time, has guiding significant understanding of the etiology of sporadic AD. In addition, gene expression in the hippocampus of 76 AD patients and 40 healthy controls was analyzed. It was found that 12 genes are related to the course of AD, which may be used as markers for early diagnosis .",
        "conclusion": "The number of people with dementia is particularly high in China and poses a great challenge to the country’s economic development. Therefore, it is especially important to study the mechanisms of AD, which are currently mainly thought to be the deposition of Aβ in the brain, the formation of neuroinflammatory patches and the loss of neurons. The study of APP and its metabolites is an important part of the investigation into the mechanism of AD, and there are many potential drug targets in the pathogenesis, for which it is scientifically important and clinically promising to design advanced drugs for the treatment of AD. Under normal conditions, APP only produces soluble fragments that are nutritive to the cell; when mutations occur in the gene, the associated secretase action of APP is likely to increase. APP has two classical metabolic pathways, and α-secretase, β-secretase and γ-secretase are all widely considered to be sheddases. The extracellular domain shedding of membrane proteins that involves sheddases is normally controlled by signal transduction, and when deregulated, extracellular domain shedding is associated with pathologies such as inflammation and AD. However, sheddases and substrate proteins do not function in a one-to-one manner, and the mode of action is unclear. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the substrate specificity of sheddases, it is necessary to assign individual substrates to sheddases and to determine how protein hydrolytic cleavage affects substrate function. With further research into the pathogenesis of AD and the refinement of various potential drug targets, it is believed that appropriate drugs can be identified to alleviate the suffering of AD patients."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a polygenic multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that, after decades of research and development, is still without a cure. There are some symptomatic treatments to manage the psychological symptoms but none of these drugs can halt disease progression. Additionally, over the last few years, many anti-AD drugs failed in late stages of clinical trials and many hypotheses surfaced to explain these failures, including the lack of clear understanding of disease pathways and processes. Recently, different epigenetic factors have been implicated in AD pathogenesis; thus, they could serve as promising AD diagnostic biomarkers. Additionally, network biology approaches have been suggested as effective tools to study AD on the systems level and discover multi-target-directed ligands as novel treatments for AD. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology to provide a better understanding of disease pathogenesis hypotheses and decipher the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in disease development and progression. We also provide an overview of disease biomarkers and drug targets and suggest network biology approaches as new tools for identifying novel biomarkers and drugs.

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils in the brain, leading to the formation of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and ultimately resulting in dendritic dysfunction, neuronal cell death, memory loss, behavioral changes, and organ shutdown . It is estimated that 6.5 million Americans, 65 years and older, are living with Alzheimer’s dementia, and this number is likely to grow rapidly , reaching 13.8 million by 2060 . Additionally, approximately 10 million Americans are currently living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In fact, 50% of MCI cases are due to AD based on biomarker evidence . Eventually, 15% of MCI patients develop dementia after two years, and one-third develop dementia due to AD within five years . The number of Americans with AD-MCI and AD dementia is approximately 11.2 million . The healthcare cost for AD patients in 2022 is expected to reach USD 321 billion . Furthermore, as the global population ages, the number of people suffering from dementia is expected to triple from 50 million to 152 million by 2050 . Therefore, there is an urgent need to impede or slow down the onset and progress of the disease and ameliorate the disease-debilitating symptoms in hopes of putting an end to this disease and preventing a growing public health crisis . Multifactorial mechanisms are involved in AD pathogenesis, including genetic, epigenetic, biological, and environmental factors networking with each other . However, genomic experiments affirmed that no particular gene could be assigned as a potential target for AD pathogenesis. In fact, multiple genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to disease development . In the past decade, there has been an increased understanding of potential targets for disease-modifying therapies that delayed or slowed down the clinical course of AD. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine’s (NLM) ClinicalTrials.gov Beta (beta.clinicaltrials.gov) , there have been 1943 clinical trials of different phases and different designs to investigate new potential molecules in treating AD. Among these studies, 151 clinical trials progressed to Phase III clinical trials, in which safety and monitoring of side effects were investigated. After decades of AD drug discovery research and billions of dollars spent on clinical trials, we still do not have a single effective anti-AD drug. Promising novel strategies to developing anti-AD drugs keep failing in clinical trials . The exact cause of the disease remains the subject of ongoing debate and investigation. At this time, the most plausible hypothesis is that AD is a multifactorial disorder in which genetic and environmental risk factors interact, leading to an acceleration in the rate of normal aging. More than 600 genes contribute to AD pathogenesis, along with environmental factors and epigenetic changes . The genetic deficiencies in AD consist of germline mutations, mitochondrial DNA mutations, and single-DNA nucleotide polymorphisms . Therapeutic clinical treatment targets of AD aim to enhance behavioral, cognitive, and non-cognitive symptoms of the diseases. In the last two decades, there were no new medication approvals for the treatment or the prevention of AD. Currently, the aim of developing new anti-AD agents is to utilize new disease-modifying agents that delay the onset or slow down the progression of an established disease. Aβ, tau protein, and cell oxidation are the most currently promising targets to modify the pathologic status of Alzheimer’s disease . In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of AD pathophysiological hypotheses, classifications, diagnostic biomarkers, and currently approved pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options. Moreover, we discuss the emerging role of the microbiome as well as epigenetics in the pathogenesis of AD and discuss the potential of epigenetic and genetic treatment options. We also provide a summary on drugs being developed or currently investigated in clinical trials, their success, failures or drawbacks, newer target approaches, and most important considerations for conducting effective future clinical trials. In addition, we discuss novel approaches for the proper diagnosis and drug-development for AD through exploiting network biology, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML).",
        "conclusion": "AD is a multifactorial and polygenetic disease. Novel disease diagnostic biomarkers and disease-modifying treatments are required to halt or slow the onset and disease progression, decrease behavioral aberrations, and ameliorate cognition in AD patients. The recent advances in network biology approaches coupled with the advances in clinical trial design and protocols, in additional to the availability of powerful machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, hold promise to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers, better drug targets, and effective disease-modifying drugs. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on Alzheimer’s disease highlighting the mainstream hypotheses explaining disease pathophysiology as well as current disease treatments and drug discovery projects. We also emphasize the recent scientific evidence implicating epigenetic mechanisms and the microbiome in AD pathogenesis and progression. We suggest that the application of Al and ML approaches in analyzing AD network biology derived from AD data, including genetic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, and metagenomic data would revolutionize our understanding of the disease pathways and will lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers and drug targets. Ultimately, these studies will increase our chances of identifying validated diagnostic biomarkers and effective disease-modifying cures. Hence, breakthrough discoveries in AD research are more likely to occur in the near future. This review provides a summary of the current hypotheses regarding AD pathogenesis in addition to the most recent advances in the search of effective disease biomarkers and drug targets. This review also details AD drugs in various stages of development and highlights technologies that are expected to accelerate AD drug and biomarker discoveries."

        "abstract": "The definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) without the need for neuropathological confirmation remains a challenge in AD research today, despite efforts to uncover the molecular and biological underpinnings of the disease process. Furthermore, the potential for therapeutic intervention is limited upon the onset of symptoms, providing motivation for studying and treating the AD precursor mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the prodromal stage of AD instead. Applying machine learning classification to transcriptomic data of MCI, AD, and cognitively normal (CN) control patients, we identified differentially expressed genes that serve as biomarkers for the characterization and classification of subjects into MCI or AD groups. Predictive models employing these biomarker genes exhibited good classification performances for CN, MCI, and AD, significantly above random chance. The PI3K-Akt, IL-17, JAK-STAT, TNF, and Ras signaling pathways were also enriched in these biomarker genes, indicating their diagnostic potential and pathophysiological roles in MCI and AD. These findings could aid in the recognition of MCI and AD risk in clinical settings, allow for the tracking of disease progression over time in individuals as part of a therapeutic approach, and provide possible personalized drug targets for early intervention of MCI and AD.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most widely studied neurodegenerative disorders, and is associated with widespread brain atrophy and cognitive decline. It is clinically characterized by memory deficits, and patients develop progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy, delusions, and agitation (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that AD is the most common form of dementia and that it stands to be the seventh leading cause of death in elderly worldwide. The neuropathology of AD is widely associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, and the definitive diagnosis of AD is only possible by post-mortem microscopic examination of brain tissues (2). While neuropathologic changes are well correlated with cognitive decline in AD (3), it remains unfeasible to examine brain tissue for AD diagnosis in clinical settings. Diagnostic approaches for AD historically involve the interpretation of neuroimaging data, neuropsychological tests and laboratory tests (4). Although much progress has been made in the diagnosis of AD, the methodology of diagnosis relies heavily on clinicians' interpretations of laboratory results and neuropsychological tests for detecting cognitive deficits (5), with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers such as phosphorylated tau only being recently included as considerations for clinical diagnosis (6). However, the reliability of AD diagnosis remains variable due to several confounders such as human interpretation, age and education. For instance, the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is widely used by clinicians for the screening of dementia by administering a 30-points questionnaire to evaluate a subject's orientation, recall, attention, language, and comprehension abilities. While the MMSE is a quick way of assessing subjects' cognitive decline, its use in monitoring the progression of AD is limited due to its low sensitivity to intermediate conditions such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (7). The complexity due to the different variants of AD also requires clinicians to evaluate a subject's condition by relying on a combination of other non-quantitative factors for diagnosis, which can include, but are not limited to, the medical history of patients, neuroimaging, and interviewing patients' kin (8). This complex combination of diagnostic factors often leads to variability in diagnosis by different clinicians, therefore a diagnostic approach that is based on quantitative measurements of the biological process of AD will be useful to provide more timely and accurate AD screening. Recent advancements in genome sequencing technology have contributed to improved accessibility of large transcriptomic datasets, leading to greater opportunities for identifying biomarkers associated with complex and rare diseases (9). The quantification of biomarkers from gene expression profiles may be a possible diagnostic approach for AD that reduces reliance on clinicians' experience thereby reducing human error and eliminating subjectivity in diagnosis. Gene expression profiles from several studies have uncovered valuable patterns in AD patients, namely the presence of Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain (10). Unfortunately, such approaches still face the limitation of using brain tissue from biopsies, which carries the risk of complications (11), and may not be translatable to all clinical settings. Alternatively, blood gene expression profiles may prove useful in AD screening with significant reduction of risks and greater tissue accessibility. Two large-scale blood gene expression datasets were conducted in recent years that aim to detect biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI; (12)] and AddNeuroMed (13, 14), which include subjects from North America and Europe respectively Both studies comprise similar protocols and data modalities, namely clinical and cognitive tests, blood transcriptomics, and neuroimaging, although the ADNI includes additional data from positron emission tomography imaging and from genetic studies on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD (15). In this study, we identified gene expression profiles associated with inflammation, vascular dementia, MCI, AD, stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases in a Singaporean MCI and AD cohort. The focus on a largely inflammatory set of genes stems from earlier work suggesting that neuroinflammation in AD is closely linked to neurodegeneration, the severity of which can be observed as alterations in white matter hyperintensity through neuroimaging. We therefore aim to identify potential biomarkers that could predict neuroinflammatory changes before severe and irreversible neurodegeneration in AD, or even in MCI, so as to provide early intervention. Our findings were then validated using blood gene expression data from ADNI. However, blood gene expression studies are limited by two main drawbacks. Firstly, the gene expression profiles are usually difficult to interpret due to the data being highly variable (16). Secondly, the large proportion of genes to a small proportion of subjects creates a statistical hurdle in the search for potential biomarkers. Technological advancements in recent years have provided various supervised and unsupervised models for the applications in features extraction of large expression datasets (17). Supervised machine learning models, such as Random Forests (RF), are particularly useful in such applications due to their flexibility in both classification and regression studies. RF also has the advantage of tackling the non-linear nature of gene expression profiles (18). In this study, we employed a multi-stage machine learning pipeline for the exploration of selecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD and MCI subjects. The analysis pipeline was built upon Boruta, a statistically driven machine learning method, which differentiated the important genes from noise after rigorous iterations of RF models (19). We showed that machine learning techniques may prove useful in discovering potential biomarkers for AD and MCI detection in the large data pool of blood gene expressions.",
        "conclusion": "Visualization of the blood gene expression profile using UMAP did not show distinctive clusters of AD, MCI and CN, illustrating the heterogeneous nature of AD. The visualization under UMAP also demonstrated that the underlying structure of detecting biomarkers in AD could not be resolved easily even when using non-linear approaches. Therefore, conventional classification approaches will likely be ineffective and a robust machine learning algorithm will be required for a more accurate biomarker identification. In this regard, RF was chosen for its versatile applications in classification and regression, and Boruta was employed to further increase robustness. In this study, we employed a machine learning pipeline for the identification of AD-related genes, which in turn highlighted five signaling pathways that could potentially be used for discriminating between stages of AD progression. We recognize that the ambiguity of a patient's true condition, under the MCI classification, may influence the feature selection as not all MCI patients evolve to AD, and some individuals can even revert back to CN. This suggests that the disease progression from MCI to AD is non-linear, as previously suggested in literature (34). The clinical diagnosis of MCI, upon which our feature selection algorithm depends, is also challenging due to the lack of clear distinguishing symptoms. In addition, the worsening of MCI may develop into other forms of dementia besides AD. Nevertheless, the association between MCI and AD development provides motivation for studying both of them in conjunction. By considering MCI and AD as different conditions, we aim to identify not only potential blood biomarkers for AD diagnosis, but also biomarkers for MCI diagnosis, with the goal to provide early intervention for AD by detection of MCI subjects before they progress into AD. Early detection of MCI subjects and treatment may alleviate their symptoms in the early stages and reduce the probability of MCI patients progressing into AD. The genes identified in this study are able to classify subjects as belonging to either CN, MCI, or AD groups, with greater than random accuracy, thus supporting their potential application in biomarker panels for diagnostic purposes in clinical settings. However, the classification accuracies observed in this study also suggest that MCI and AD are highly complex and heterogeneous. This could have been a result of the gene expression landscape between healthy and diseased groups being relatively similar overall (35, 36). To reduce variability resulting from class imbalance in our data during feature selection and evaluation, we performed SMOTE on both our training and testing data, and employed several iterations of Boruta, with majority voting to reduce the likelihood of false positives being included in our final set of DEGs. Further validation and investigation of these DEGs as clinically relevant biomarkers for MCI and AD will ideally be conducted in the future using a much larger dataset (than the current NNI data used in this study), that is also supported by common AD biomarkers such as amyloid and tau. Despite the discovery cohort being relatively small, our classification models using DEGs identified from NNI data also classified subjects with greater than random accuracy when validated on external ADNI data, with comparable prediction accuracies across all three pairwise comparisons of CN vs. MCI, CN vs. AD, and MCI vs. AD. Therefore, our DEGs can be generalized to different cohorts of subjects from varying geographical regions and data collection methods. The five pathways (PI3K-Akt, IL-17, JAK-STAT, TNF, and Ras signaling) identified from gene enrichment analysis of the DEGs represent potential changes in biochemical signaling over different stages of MCI and AD onset and development. It is likely that all of the five pathways undergo some dysregulation during the course of MCI development and AD progression. The finding of inflammatory pathways in the differential gene expression analysis is not particularly surprising, given that the initial set of NNI genes were also associated with several inflammatory processes. Despite this, the localization of the different pathways to different regions of the Venn diagram in Figure 4 indicates that at different stages of disease progression, different pathways could experience more detectable transcriptomic changes. This has applications in diagnostic practice and personalized medicine–although MCI is associated with increased systemic inflammation in general (37), greater dysregulation of specific pathways could provide indications of disease stages in each patient, and provide potential targets for that disease stage. Additional challenges remain to be addressed regarding blood transcriptomes as biomarkers for disease diagnosis. Relating the dynamics of gene expression in the brain to blood can be confounded by changes in RNA availability rather than specific pathway dysregulation, such as the possibility that extensive neuronal death in highly inflammatory environments could lead to less detectable RNA changes at later AD stages (38). Therefore, it would be prudent to consider if the observed transcriptional changes detected were indeed associated with disease progression. Each of the five pathways identified in this study has individually been implicated in cognitive impairment, particularly when they are altered in the central nervous system, even in neurological conditions not directly linked to AD (39–43). Should their expression levels in blood aid in identifying individuals with cognitive impairment accurately, dysregulation of these pathways would be possible biomarkers for MCI. An association between brain and blood levels of their expression, with corroboration from behavioral studies, would further support the utility of these pathways as tools for assessing patients' risks of developing MCI and AD onset, providing opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The five inflammatory pathways observed from gene enrichment have each been associated with AD, albeit usually in the context of pathway dysregulation in the brain. Of note, IL-17A demonstrates a strong correlation with the pathogenesis of AD, and evidence of elevated IL-17A was observed in AD patients (44). Studies performed on rodents with Aβ-induced neurodegeneration demonstrated improved memory function after treatment with IL-17 antibodies (45). This provides strong evidence that the inhibition of IL-17 reduces the degenerative effects of Aβ in the glial cells, preventing further complications in AD patients. Another pathway that holds potential in the treatment of AD is the TNF signaling pathway. Numerous studies have described the elevation of TNF-α in AD patients (46, 47) and the intervention of this pathway has been shown to alleviate brain pathology in rodent models (48). Additionally, the role of the TNF signaling pathway is supported by a recent genome-wide association study, which suggests that regulation of this pathway and its interactions with other signaling pathways could be implicated in AD development and neuropathology (49). Several drugs have been proposed to target different parts of the TNF signaling pathway and there is some reported clinical evidence suggesting that intervention of this pathway lowers AD neuropathology (50). Currently there are a few FDA approved drugs that target the IL-17A signaling and TNF signaling pathways. A few drug examples include Secukinumab, an antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes IL-17A, and Etanercept, a biological antagonist to TNF-α, that has been shown in a pilot study to improve cognitive function (51). This information may be applicable in the treatment of MCI patients, if early detection and diagnosis is conducted through routine blood tests, to prevent the potential development of AD. Additionally, the JAK-STAT signaling and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were found to be differentially expressed between AD, MCI and CN, serving as potential grounds for future research or drug targets. Although the mechanism behind how these pathways lead to development of AD is unclear, past investigations have found correlations between altered activity of these pathways and development of AD. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway was found to be activated in reactive astrocytes present in rodent models (52), although the mechanism of how JAK-STAT is involved in AD has not been studied extensively. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were found to be inhibited by Aβ, leading to neuronal death (53), but the mechanism of how this occurs is still not well understood. The involvement of these two pathways in AD pathophysiology could be explored in further research, with the possibility of them being therapeutic targets. Ras/ERK signaling and its associated MAPK signaling pathway have also been investigated widely in contexts of disease due to their diverse regulatory roles in processes such as cell survival, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. In AD, ERK proteins are hypothesized to play a role in mediating Tau hyperphosphorylation and β-secretase expression which influences Aβ aggregation (54). Ras/ERK signaling has also been shown to be activated by Aβ, with the resultant aberrant signaling leading to neurodegeneration in AD (41). Therefore, early detection and targeted treatment for Ras signaling dysregulation could provide a means for preventing prolific Aβ aggregation and neurodegeneration in early AD. Differential expression in these five pathways indicates that these pathways are dysregulated at different stages of disease development over MCI and AD, although it should be noted that the complex relationship between blood and brain expression makes interpretation of blood gene expression difficult, specifically in understanding how differential expression in blood is indicative of transcriptional patterns in the brain. The transcriptional signature of some gene modules in the brain, particularly those with roles in basic cellular processes such as gene expression regulation and infection, have been observed to be preserved in the blood of healthy subjects (55). In AD patients, especially at advanced stages of disease, strong blood-brain correlation for transcription has been observed, including brain-specific genes and inflammation-associated genes (56). However, blood-brain transcriptional correlation in MCI subjects remains to be established. While further investigation is needed before it can be concluded if these patterns of dysregulation definitively reflect neurophysiological changes in the brain, the findings of past human and animal studies suggest that the blood and brain transcriptome are correlated for some pathways, including inflammatory genes such as those studied here, especially in neurodegeneration (57). Another challenge in identifying blood biomarkers of disease relates to population heterogeneity. Highly generalisable biomarkers are rarely available, due to heterogeneity between individuals, even within the healthy control population–the blood transcriptome is highly dynamic and inflammatory processes may vary in response to age, underlying disease, viral infection, or even seasonal changes (16). This not only presents an opportunity for personalized medicine, but also highlights its importance in MCI and AD diagnosis. Since the expression of these inflammatory pathways is dynamic and highly variable even in healthy subjects, there is a risk of false positives in MCI and AD diagnosis if one only considers differences in expression levels of genes in the five pathways between individuals. Consequently, in evaluating MCI and AD risk of an individual, it may be beneficial to track longitudinal changes in expression of the five pathways for each subject, rather than making a diagnosis based on data from a single time point. There are several previously published studies that aim to identify blood biomarkers of AD using blood gene expression data (14, 34–36, 58–60). A number of these studies employed publicly available data from AddNeuroMed for biomarker discovery and evaluation, although the different methods for feature selection and classification employed for each study resulted in varying differentially expressed features between AD and CN subjects (14, 34, 35, 59, 60). To overcome variations in individual differentially expressed genes, researchers may employ pathway-based classification models instead (14, 36), which we also include in our investigation. Through pathway analysis, there is more consensus between studies–for instance, the JAK-STAT pathway we identify in this investigation was also mentioned as a pathway of interest by Li et al. (35). Here, our study differs from previously published work in that we focus on biomarkers of MCI as indicators of AD risk, and on the pathways that are implicated across the development of MCI and AD, rather than just differential expression at each stage compared to CN. The findings of this study provide potential blood biomarker genes and pathways for assessing MCI and AD risk in individuals. However, the complex molecular landscape of MCI and AD presents opportunities for further research, with the aim of making definitive diagnoses based on RNA extracted from blood. For instance, the relationship between blood RNA levels and RNA and protein levels in the brain could be further explored to determine how the differences observed in blood between conditions are linked to physiological changes in the brain during AD progression. Another aspect that could be considered is how the biomarkers identified in this study compare against blood biomarkers for other diseases, especially inflammatory conditions. A machine learning pipeline employing Boruta effectively identifies DEGs in AD, which can classify subjects as either MCI or AD patients. These genes are enriched in five pathways–the PI3K-Akt, IL-17, JAK-STAT, TNF, and Ras signaling pathways–which are possibly dysregulated in MCI and AD. These pathways are also potential biomarkers that classify MCI and AD patients with reasonable accuracy. Our study demonstrates the potential to make use of these discovered biomarkers for early diagnosis of MCI and AD patients through routine blood testing, thereby providing biological insights toward early intervention through targeted drug treatment development for preventing deterioration into AD. These biomarker pathways may also provide targets for disease monitoring over time as an approach for personalized medicine as their transcriptional patterns are altered as MCI develops into AD."

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive and irreversible neurodegeneration characterized by the impairment of memory and cognition. Despite years of studies, no effective treatment and prevention strategies are available yet. Identifying new AD therapeutic targets is crucial for better elucidating the pathogenesis and establishing a valid treatment of AD. Growing evidence suggests that microglia play a critical role in AD. Microglia are resident macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS), and their core properties supporting main biological functions include surveillance, phagocytosis, and the release of soluble factors. Activated microglia not only directly mediate the central immune response, but also participate in the pathological changes of AD, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation, tau protein phosphorylation, synaptic dissection, neuron loss, memory function decline, etc. Based on these recent findings, we provide a new framework to summarize the role of microglia in AD memory impairment. This evidence suggests that microglia have the potential to become new targets for AD therapy.",

        "introduction": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide closely related to age, and its main clinical features are irreversible memory loss, cognitive dysfunction, and personality changes . AD mostly occurs in elderly individuals over 65 years old and seriously affects their ability in daily life. AD is now a major medical and social problem worldwide . The main pathological features of AD are the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein . Aβ and NFT can cause oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an imbalance of biometal homeostasis , ultimately leading to synaptic loss, dendritic spine reduction, and neuronal death . Despite extensive research over the years, the underlying pathogenesis of AD remains unclear. The current treatment for AD still targets Aβ, but clinical trials have failed . Once AD is initiated, not a single drug can stop or reverse disease progression, meaning that new molecular targets urgently need to be identified. The study of novel and highly effective molecular targets for AD has become a global focus. Since Alois Alzheimer first discovered that microglia are associated with Aβ plaques in the brains of AD patients , microglia have attracted much attention. Wegiel found that the number of microglia in the brains of patients with AD was positively correlated with the size of Aβ plaques and the activated microglia clustered around them . All these findings indicate that microglial activation is a key feature of AD. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) techniques to diagnose AD found that activation of microglia in the brains of patients with AD precedes cognitive and memory decline , indicating that microglia may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Increasing recent evidence shows that microglia are closely related to AD memory impairment. A close spatiotemporal relationship between Aβ and microglia was found in both AD animal models and AD patients . Microglia tightly wrap around Aβ plaques to form a barrier, preventing outward development, and thus, limiting the toxic effects of the plaques on peripheral neurons . Microglia-induced neuro-inflammation directly damages neurons while promoting abnormal protein aggregation in AD patient brains . Aβ was found in microglial cells, providing direct evidence that microglia clear Aβ by phagocytosis . Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) found many AD-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with microglia, among which 29 have been identified as highly expressed in microglia , such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), myeloid cell surface antigen CD33, and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A Member 7 (ABCA7) . All these findings indicate that microglia may play a key role in the occurrence and development of AD. Therefore, microglia have the potential to become a new target for AD treatment. In this review, we begin by illustrating microglia’s origin, morphology states, and physiological functions, with an emphasis on their functions in the adult brain; then, we conduct a detailed discussion about the presently proposed mechanism of microglial contribution to AD memory deficits. By summarizing the recent findings about the causal relationship between microglia and AD, and the related clinical implications, we hope that this study can strengthen the understanding on the important role of microglia in AD-related synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. As the clinical trials for drugs targeting Aβ have all failed, it is plausible to rethink the potential of microglia manipulation as a therapeutic to ameliorate the cognitive deficits associated with AD.",
        "conclusion": "AD is one of the major medical and social problems without effective treatment worldwide. Many recent studies have disclosed the critical role of microglial activation in the development of AD pathology. Microglia activation in AD is dynamic and complicated, ranging from progressive activation to partial activation to full activation. In the early stage of AD, microglial activation can phagocytose Aβ to inhibit Aβ deposition, and thus, achieve neuroprotective effects . With AD progression, chronically activated microglia gradually lose the capability or efficiency to clear Aβ , while they continuously produce pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic factors, leading to neurodegeneration. Most recently, microglia-based therapeutic strategies did not show significant improvement on AD memory impairment, although each specific aspect of microglia activation could be selectively regulated, such as migration, phagocytosis, or cytokine release. The contribution of microglial activation in AD does not appear to be straightforward. Further studies are still required to illustrate the complicated mechanism underlying the involvement of microglia in AD pathogenesis. Targeting microglia may provide a potential strategy for the accurate treatment of memory impairment associated with AD."
